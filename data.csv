progress post here and I wanted to share the details of my journey  my struggles  what worked best for me and some recommendations  I love helping people out so feel free to DM or ask below any questions and I ll do my best to answer them     PHOTOS      Before and After  https   imgur com QUqEws4    Weight Loss Progression  https   imgur com Viu7xYb    Back Progress  https   imgur com a APtkOK7     GETTING STARTED  FIRST 60 LBS  JUST DIET NO LIFTING     Back in 2018 I was going through a lot of anxiety and I was using food as my escape binge eating on a regular basis  I always wanted to lose weight  but I could never stick to a diet  I also had a bad case of last supper effect in which I would put a future date on starting a diet  usually a Monday  and then eat anything I could get my hands on to enjoy myself before the diet  This repeated itself multiple times which is when I actually gained 30lbs within 2 3 months  I was taking anti acid more than once a day and I would be tired all the time   Right after Thanksgiving 2018  I decided that I needed to do something about this and my mom recommended Keto  After starting Keto  my cravings pretty much got eliminated and I felt I was happy in that diet  Of course  it helps that Keto makes you lose a good amount of water weight which is motivating when starting out  I stayed on Keto and lost 60lbs within 4 months    First Progress Post  https   www reddit com r progresspics comments b680rg m2157 260lbs 205lbs 55lbs 4 months still got ways    and plateaued my way at the 200    10lbs for a year  I also incorporated a couple of fasting days here  16 18  23   However  during this time I cheated on the diet multiple times so I stayed the same throughout the year     DEC 2019 STARTED LIFTING COVID       Pic  https   imgur com ZMzxt0m   I stared going to the gym with my roommate and he pretty much became my trainer and mentor at that point  At first he would pressure me to go but then I started actually liking going to the gym so it would be me the one that would pressure him  I went 3 4x per week until March 2020 when COVID hit  Diet was a disaster at this point  the gym helped lower the damage but I was still gaining weight  Then COVID hit and the gyms started to close     2020 SERIOUS LIFTING COVID    During March June 2020 of COVID I was doing Keto and Fasting and went as far down as 180lbs but quickly yo yoed myself back to the 190 200 range by July  The gyms started opening again which in when I started going religiously 5 6x per week  I didn t have my roommate to go with my so I got an app  FitBod  that guided me through a routine and started watching lots of videos on youtube  Here s the thing about watching videos on youtube  there s a lot of bro science out there and with time I felt more confused than ever  Wondering if I was wasting my time lifting weights while being in a deficit  I started getting overwhelmed but decided to keep at it and keep trying to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time against the advise of a lot of online  experts   I stayed consistent with the gym  diet was still a struggle and I was building muscle but not losing much fat     2021 PRESENT JUST FASTING LIFTING    As 2021 rolled in I stopped doing Keto  I had moved back with my friends and it was a struggle to have a social life with Keto when no one else was doing Keto  Fasting was giving me more options on what I would eat  within reason  during the window  This proved a better strategy for me at this stage and it proved successful because I lost the dreaded 30lbs to 170 here  Lifting stayed consistent here  no issues with that  Did a bit of orange theory that actually helped but sometimes I would unconsciously eat more than if I had not gone at all     PROGRAM    I do push  pull  legs and switch things up but here s a sample routine  I no longer do shoulders with push because my shoulders aren t very strong so it s too much to take with chest  Instead I do shoulders with legs or on a separate day with triceps   Note  these say 4 sets  I always do one warm up set with very little weight so it s really 3 sets   The ones that say 3 sets don t have warm ups     Monday   Push  Chest Triceps       4x12 8 Barbell Bench Press      Warm Up  Barbell 45 lbs  8  reps       Warm Up 2  135lbs  8 reps       155lbs  12 reps       185lbs  10 reps       205lbs  8 reps    3x13 10 Dips   3x15  Incline Push Up   3x10  Incline Tricep Push Up  or cable overhead tricep extension    4x12 8 Dumbbell Incline Bench Press  or barbell    4x12 10 Dumbbell Kickbacks  or cable one arm tricep push down    3x12 8 Machine Fly  or cable fly     Tuesday   Pull  Biceps Back       4x8 12 Dumbbell Bicep Curls   2x6 10 Pull Ups   2x8 12 Chin Ups   4x12 Hanging Knee Raise  I always finish pull chin ups with this  even it not doing abs    4x8 12 Hammer Curls   4x12 8 Dumbbell Row  or cable row    3x12 Cable double bicep curl  or ez bar curl     Wednesday   Cardio Legs      4x12 8 Deadlift   4x12 8 Squat   4x12 8 Leg Extensions   4x12 8 Leg Curl   4x12 8 Machine hip adductor   4x12 8 Machine hip abductor   4x12 8 Leg Press   10 12 minutes Stair Master  2min 6  2min 8  2 min 10  then back down    25 minutes HIIT Treadmill  real honest I just do a tread sample from the orange theory subreddit     Thursday   Shoulders Abs Optional Triceps      Friday   Push 02   Biceps Back    See above  When I repeat days I do a heavy lift day with less reps more weight  The second day I ll do lots of reps and lower weight with drop sets   Example     4x18 10ish Dumbbell Bicep Curls Drop Sets   2x8  Pull Ups   2x8  Chin Ups   4x12  Hanging Knee Raise  I always finish pull chin ups with this  even it not doing abs    4x18 12ish Hammer Curls Drop Sets   4x18 10ish Dumbbell Row  or cable row  drop sets   3x20 15 Cable double bicep curl  or ez bar curl     Saturday   Rest Repeat Legs or Chest      Sunday   Rest      DIET    Currently I m just doing fasting  16  18  23  depending on how I m feeling  With fasting I don t have to count every single calorie but I am conscious of them  With that being said  I m terrible at counting calories and I always underestimate  Instead  I just overestimate the calories on everything I eat  So I go to Chipotle  their website says my bowl is 1 000 calories  I count 1 200 calories   This is how I treat calories  I love money and not spending it  so I treat calories like money  My TDEE is 2 100 calories per day  I can choose how I spend that but if I go over my daily  then now I m in debt  If I save up today then I have some savings  If I save up 200 every day then on the weekend I can redeem that for a Crumbl cookie or something like that   With that being said  I do pay attention to my protein intake  I eat about 120g of protein  I don t sacrifice protein for a fast  So if I need a high protein yogurt or a shake after the gym  I ll break my fast for that and only for that and then immediately  resume the fast      SUPPLEMENTS    Creatine  Protein  Pre workout     LOSE SKIN     It s  not too noticeable  https   imgur com a qcHqPs0  but the skin is very elastic and you can tell if you pull on it or lay down  I do have stretch marks  battle scars  on my side and some white ones in the stomach but those aren t too noticeable  If I lose a couple more pounds it would be a lot more noticeable which is why I think I ll stay in the 170 range rather than pushing to 160  unless I can increase mass     MENTAL HEALTH    Didn t want to talk about this here but it s a crucial part of my journey so I ll briefly talk about it  A drastic transformation in relatively little time is not easy mentally speaking  It s like fast forwarding in social statuses from one night to the next  You sill feel the same on the inside but everyone treats you different and like you re worth more  Women that wouldn t speak to me 2 years ago now suddenly seem interested  You start getting compliments and don t even now how to react because no one never complimented your physical appearance before  Self confidence is still catching up and doesn t happen overnight  When you spend so much time working for a goal  it can also be easy to start focusing on imperfections  body dysphormia  so that s something that I ve been working on as well  The point is that the mind is a muscle and problems don t get solved overnight  Training and mental development is required and a crucial part of a transformation ,5643.0,

zix8xnpost,zix8xn,,MirrorMageZ,2022-12-11 15:53:03,Review Of Fitness Studies VIII: Stretching For Muscle Growth? Pain? Beta-Alanine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/zix8xn/,500.0,25.0,Hello  There was a time awhile ago where I had posted some summaries of journal articles on general fitness  The idea was to help condense important information and make it accessible to the layperson who simply wants to get healthy  I have had some free time recently and I figured I would share some cool papers I read  With this text  I hope that everyone can learn something and that a fruitful and interesting discussion can occur below  I will try my best to answer any queries people may have  Feel free to leave any criticism as well since writing educational content is a skill I am continuously trying to hone  I am not advertising any sort of product or premium access to whatever but if you would like to offer support beyond a comment in this thread  feel free to PM me  Enjoy                                                        Schoenfeld et al   2022  wrote a review on the potential for stretching in between sets to be a time efficient way to gain muscle  The theoretical basis for this novel practice consists of a few ideas  Firstly  our muscles contain many sensors that detect tension  both active and passive  We know that the active sensors are directly linked to pathways that are essential to muscle gain  We do not have much practical evidence that the passive sensors have the same links but it is possible  Other theories include flattening of the muscle cell nuclei  the control centre of the cell  and opening of specific channels in the muscle whenever we stretch  Again  this is all highly theoretical and we have yet to see any findings that explicitly demonstrate that these processes lead to muscle gain   Upon the foundation of promising animal studies  there have been a few studies looking at humans using stretching during rest periods between sets to try to elicit more muscle gains  Unfortunately  the results are fairly equivocal when looking at the entirety of the data and most of the studies were all conducted a little differently  Van Every et al   2022  carried out an experiment in which 21 young  untrained males performed a straight leg calf raise on a leg press machine and a seated calf raise for 4 sets each  twice a week for 8 weeks  If you would like to understand why they did these two exercises specifically  refer to the side note below   The catch in the study was that one calf would rest for 2 minutes between sets as one would usually do while the other calf would stretch for 30 seconds during the 2 minute rest period  The stretch would use the full load of their set  For example  if the participant was calf raising 50 kilograms on the leg press  after the final repetition  they would keep the 50 kilograms on and immediately descend into a stretched position and hold it for 30 seconds  Unfortunately  the authors did not specify how  hard  the subjects should stretch  All the participants were familiarized with the exercises for a week prior to the exercise programme and they also did 10 repetition maximum testing to prescribe adequate loads  All sets were done to failure in the 8 12 repetition range  To observe muscle changes  the researchers used ultrasound scans and they also used a dynamometer to detect muscle strength adaptations  The ultrasound measures were conducted 48 hours away from exercise to prevent muscle swelling from influencing the observations   The authors found that the soleus grew more in the calves that had been stretched during the inter set rest periods  However  the range of differences between groups in soleus growth spans from absolutely no difference at all to a large difference  It should also be highlighted that we expect a range of error in measurement and the finding falls within this range so it is possible this difference was not real and can be attributed to lack of precision in ultrasound technique or interpretation  The strength changes were similar in that the stretch group had greater strength improvements but the variation in results was high  Other calf muscles did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups  If we assume the greater soleus growth to be true  it may be related to the soleus  muscle architecture  It is composed of mainly type 1 fibers  low force production but high fatigue resistance  with shorter muscle fibers that are usually rather resistant to growth  While the results are not incredible  this low risk method of training may help with the stubborn calf muscle gains and muscle growth in general   Coming back to the review by Schoenfeld et al   2022   they recommend that if you would like to implement stretches between sets  it should be done immediately after set completion  This is due to a phenomenon known as  residual force enhancement   When we stretch a muscle under load as opposed to passively  it actually produces more tension  For example  instead of hopping off the calf raise machine to do a stretch  it may be better to stay on the machine while putting yourself in the bottom  stretched position under the exercise workload  The authors advise to hold the stretch at at least an 8 on the rate of perceived exertion scale  It is also likely that stretching using the load you lift during the working sets is beneficial     TL DR    Stretching between sets is a novel idea that may be a time efficient way to increase muscle growth  However  much more research is needed     Side Note    The seated calf raise allows for better targeting of the soleus muscle  the muscle deeper in the calf  To understand why this happens  we must grasp some mechanical concepts of the muscle  A muscle is able to produce the most force at certain lengths  If the muscle is too taut or too slack  it is unable to create as much force  In the science world  this is referred to as the muscle length tension relationship   Basically  this is because for force production to occur  proteins in our muscles need to form bridges  When the muscle is too taut or too slack  the bridges are not able to be properly built resulting in low force production  Keeping that in mind  let us take a look at the gastrocnemius  which is the calf muscle that lies on top of your soleus muscle  The gastrocnemius originates from a bone in your thigh  above and behind your knee  It travels down the back of your leg and attaches behind your heel    You can pretend that this muscle is a string that is attached between these two points  Now imagine pulling on this string and two things should happen  One  your ankle will bend which causes your toes to be pointed forward like a ballerina  Second  your knee will bend  So what is special about the gastrocnemius is that it is able to perform movements at both the knee and the ankle  However  if for example  the gastrocnemius is helping the knee bend to a great degree  like in a seated calf raise  that means that the gastrocnemius is shortening a lot  If you remember what was mentioned earlier  this means that the gastrocnemius is now at a length where it cannot produce a lot of force because of how shortened it has become  So if I were to now ask the gastrocnemius to do an ankle movement  like a seated calf raise  it would be difficult as it cannot produce much force at an already shortened length  How are we able to do a seated calf raise then  Luckily  the soleus does not attach above the knee so its length is unaffected when we bend or straighten our knee  Thus  the soleus is the main provider of force to complete the seated calf raise  This phenomenon that the gastrocnemius muscle encounters  and many others muscles as well   is called  active insufficiency   We are able to use active insufficiency to our advantage in many cases but perhaps we can cover that another time                           The next paper we are covering is by Harvie et al   2015  in which they explore how visual feedback affects the pain experience  Regardless if you are active or sedentary  you are bound to encounter injuries in your life  Naturally  pain is associated with these injuries and the pain sensation comes in a variety of forms  Everyone will have their own unique stories with pain and this paper will serve as an excellent tool to understanding more about how pain works and what factors affect the feeling of pain   The researchers recruited 24 people with chronic neck pain and had them perform neck rotations while wearing a virtual reality headset  The participants would be seated in a chair with a belt strapped around their body at the shoulders to isolate the neck rotation  The virtual reality headset allowed the experimenters to adjust the rotation speed of the virtual environment  For example  if they were to slow down the virtual rotation speed and you turned your head 45 degrees  it may only look like you have turned your head 35 degrees because the rotation in the virtual world is so slow  The researchers created three different conditions that each subject went through  The first was under normal settings where the virtual reality rotation and real life rotation were matched 1 to 1  The other conditions involved either the virtual rotation being slower or faster than real life rotation by 20   20  was chosen because in a previous study  people could tell that virtual rotation speeds had been adjusted if they went beyond 20  in either direction  Each subject would do 6 rotations to both sides under each condition and indicate their pain level on a 0 10 scale  Computer programs would measure how far people were able to rotate their necks before the onset of pain  The virtual environment was also different for every condition to prevent people from using visual cues as an anchor for maintaining the same rotation every time   It was found that when the virtual rotation speed was slower than real life  people were able to rotate their necks further by about 6  before the onset of pain  When the virtual rotation speed was faster  the pain free range of motion of neck rotation was 7  less on average  These findings indicate that what we see plays a part in how we experience pain  Over the years  we have come to understand that pain is a protective alarm system that the body uses to alert us of a threat  This threat can arise from a multitude of sources  If we get punched in the face  tissues likely get damaged and our body produces pain since the damage has created a threat  In response  we may cover our face  go hide or seek treatment as we would like to protect ourselves  However  we can feel pain even when there is no tissue damage at all as long as our brain is perceiving something as a threat  Perhaps we are not sleeping well as we are stressed about an upcoming exam and suddenly we experience knee pain in a knee that was injured years ago but has healed since then  What if we open up the knee and find that there is absolutely no tissue damage  How is it possible that the knee is feeling any pain at all  Well the stress from the poor sleep and exam has built up and has become a threat to us as perceived by the brain which can accentuate pain from acute or chronic injuries   In the study  the brain sees that the neck has been rotated too much and elicits a pain response in your body  This is to protect you because it believes that if you rotate too much  you will over stress the tissue and cause further damage  The brain is likely wrong in this case but the protective system exists nonetheless  However  the brain depends on several factors before producing pain  In this case  it is clear that it is using visual feedback to create pain  Altering the visual feedback thus changes the pain sensation accordingly  In our lives  however  pain modulation goes beyond visual feedback  An eloquent analogy I picked up from Barbell Medicine is that pain is like hunger  If you just went through a break up  you might go through a whole tub of ice cream in one sitting  If you are out with friends you might eat more as well  There are many influences on how hungry you are and the same idea goes for pain  That is why it is incredibly important that when you are evaluating your pain  consider not only what may be happening physically or biologically but also consider what is happening psychologically or socially  Family issues  Problems at work  Feeling depressed lately  All of these examples have the capacity to moderate the pain you feel and it will be unique to each person     TL DR    Pain is the product of a system run by your brain to protect you from threats  Threats can be physical  mental  emotional and social  Pain is like hunger  several things can influence either sensation  This study used virtual reality to alter what we see and by extension  change our pain experience                           Beta alanine is likely a supplement we have all heard about and consumed especially if you use pre workout formulas  Let s take a look at a meta analysis conducted by Saunders et al   2017  to get a better idea of what beta alanine is and to explore its effectiveness in muscle performance  A meta analysis is essentially a process in which multiple studies are put together to consolidate all their findings into one massive study  This helps us discover relationships that would not be possible to uncover in one study alone  Before we get into the potential performance effects  let us briefly look over how beta alanine works  As we exercise  muscles become more acidic over time which results in poorer performance  Carnosine is a protein found in our muscles and it is important for several reasons  one of which is to manage how acidic or alkaline our muscles get  Carnosine is actually partly made up of beta alanine and thus beta alanine is also necessary to prevent our muscles from getting too acidic  Knowing all this  it is clear that beta alanine may have a potential benefit in boosting muscular endurance but is that really the case   The meta analysis found that there was a small benefit in exercise performance done over a minute and beyond  If we go below a minute   especially under 30 seconds   we do not really see any meaningful ergogenic use  This makes sense as intense activities that are short in duration will not be limited by how acidic our muscles are  The effects of beta alanine seem to be much more evident in exercises that are performed to failure rather than exercises that are not  Whether or not you are a novice or an experienced athlete  beta alanine appears to exhibit the same effects  The type of exercise also has no bearing on beta alanine and its function  The authors also did analysis on sodium bicarbonate and effects on performance when co supplemented with beta alanine  Sodium bicarbonate has similar mechanisms for improving endurance in that it also manages the acidity of muscles  It was discovered that sodium bicarbonate had a slightly better boost to performance when taken with beta alanine compared to taking beta alanine alone  Perhaps we can take a deeper dive into sodium bicarbonate another time as it presents some promise and other research into the compound has been done since this meta analysis   While there is likely a small benefit to muscular endurance when supplementing with beta alanine  it is important that these improvements are only apparent when taking doses over a period of time  Taking an acute dose  in your pre workout for example  will do nothing for performance  The authors suggest taking 3 2 6 4 grams per day for 4 to 12 weeks with the doses spread across the day  0 8 1 6 grams every few hours   The spaces between doses help prevent the occurrence of unwanted side effects like tingling sensations     TL DR    Beta alanine likely offers a small boost to muscular endurance in activities that go beyond 30 seconds to 1 minute  You can consider supplementing with 3 2 6 4 grams per day for 4 to 12 weeks with the doses spread across the day  0 8 1 6 grams every few hours  if it is safe for you to consume   Harvie  D  S   Broecker  M   Smith  R  T   Meulders  A   Madden  V  J     Moseley  G  L   2015    Bogus Visual Feedback Alters Onset of

CRcvYUf jpg      INTRO BACKGROUND      I first ran Super Squats when I was in college  well over 15 years ago and never ran it again since   In my mind it was one of the most effective programs of all time AND once of the most traumatic experiences of all time   I could still remember the pain of those 20 rep sets  the anxiety that existed between workouts  and being SO happy when it was over   I said I d run it again some day  and had recommended the book to SO many trainees  yet took SO long to finally saddle back up and do it all over again     A lot had changed between then and now   One of the biggest factors being that I had my ACL reconstructed in 2015 after rupturing it and part of my meniscus in a strongman competition   That changes squats a little   But I was also much smarter about training and nutrition than I was as a meathead college kid  so that s cool     For the full rundown on stats  I m 37  5 9  bodyweight somewhere in the high 180s  have lifted weights for 23 years  competed in strongman for a decade off and on  did some powerlifting  combat sports martial arts experience  and has accumulated some bumps and scrapes along the way         WHAT SUPER SQUATS IS IS NOT      First  it is NOT a squatting program   Oh my god I hate how I have to keep explaining this   Am I the ONLY one who got taught  Don t judge a book by its cover    Same thing with the  30lbs of muscle in 6 weeks  thing  quit focusing on that   The squatting in Super Squats is PURELY a mechanism employed to trigger muscular bodyweight growth in a trainee   It wasn t a program designed with  improving your squat as much as possible   or  the surefire solution to chicken legs    the BREATHING squat is chosen because it s a way to trigger full body growth   And no  I don t mean  it causes the release of HGH testosterone   I m talking about the fact that  when you do breathing squats  you spend a LOT of time with a weight on your back  which is signaling to your body that the whole BODY needs a LOT more muscle SOON if it wants to survive   The squatting itself adds stimulus  absolutely  but I ve found that one can employ good mornings to a similar effect  and there s a solid argument about being able to employ trap bar lifts as well     It is a SYSTEM  not a workout   Specifically  that system is premised upon the idea of putting the entire body under SIGNIFICANT stress 2 3 times a week  and consistently upping that stress so that it s never able to fully cope   This is why you use the weight you d squat for 10 to do 20 reps  and it s why you add 5lbs per workout   A lot of folks seem to think the magic is just in the squat set  so they ll do a set of 20 breathing squats ONE time and go  Yeah  that was hard  but I don t see the big deal    The big deal is that you have to do it AGAIN 2 days later with 5lbs more than before for 6 weeks   You can t just take the squats part of Super Squats in isolation  it s a whole system   It s also why the gallon of milk a day is associated with it  it s a system of training insanely hard and then eating VERY big so that you can be recovered enough to achieve the next goal   It s why when people ask  what should I do if I fail  on the program  I tell them  don t    If you are actually eating as much as you need to eat and following the program  success should be your only outcome assuming you have the necessary mental fortitude to get through it      It is a BOOK  https   www amazon com Super Squats Pounds Muscle Weeks dp 0926888005    Every time I see a trainee fail with  Super Squats   it s because they re not actually doing Super Squats  because they didn t read the book   The book can be read in an afternoon and it s  10 on Kindle  there s zero excuse for not reading it   It explains EVERYTHING   It doesn t just lay out a program  it walks you through step by step how to execute it  gives you instructions on how to perform ALL the exercises  it lays out a very effective nutrition protocol  it gives you psychological coaching to get through the squat set  along with saying MANY times that it s 3 deep breaths between EVERY rep but I digress   and even goes into the history of squatting and strong people in general  and EVEN gives you a follow on plan so you can actually run Super Squats for QUITE a long duration   There is a reason I practically THROW this book at every new trainee  if you read it  you will have pretty much everything you could ever need     MY RUN OF THE PROGRAM      When I began Super Squats  I was amazed at how many people who read my blog kept asking me what my plan was    You started at 315lbs  are you planning on going all the way to 405 for 20     You ve done 5x10x405  are you planning on going higher than 405     Are you planning on making this even more challenging than the book says     I kept saying the same thing   My goal is to experience this experience    It was to the point that I think OTHER people were getting anxiety over my  lack of a plan      Folks  CHAOS IS THE PLAN   It s not just a thing I say  it s the truth      and BOY was it the truth   When I originally mapped out the 6 week block of Super Squats  I had a full 6 weeks on my schedule with uninterrupted time set out   2 weeks before I started  my job threw a trip on my schedule from Mon through Thurs of my first week of the program    Cool  time to call an audible   I did the first workout on a Friday  my second workout the Monday I left for the trip  and the third workout on the Friday that I returned home      except that  in between Monday and Friday  on that work trip  I came down with RSV   On Tuesday night of that week  I did not sleep  because my fever was so high I had forgotten how to sleep   I literally ate non stop for 2 hours before that  because my kid had RSV before I left and they were taking FOREVER to heal because they wouldn t eat  so I knew calories were the answer   My appetite was shot  but that s never slowed me down before  and  thankfully  my room was fully stocked with travel food  because I know how to travel      and then I STILL did my 3rd workout on Friday  with RSV and promptly proceeded to pull something in my innerquad outer hamstring on my right leg on rep 15  because I forgot to factor in the significant impact of dehydration when you ve been losing all your fluids to an awful ragged cough   Which  if you want some real fun  try BREATHING squats with RSV   Also  symptoms last for 2 weeks so that s cool     Whelp  Chaos it the Plan   What Would Bruce Randall Do    He d do some goddamn good mornings  and that was EXACTLY what I did   I figured  if a dude that broke his leg in 7 places could use good mornings to build up to a 600lb squat  I could use them to get through Super Squats    Cue one of the hardest workouts of my life  https   www youtube com watch v Vp0RHBNFwgo      I kept the weight EXACTLY the same as what I failed on with the squats  because I figured THAT was the most significant part of the program   It s why I picked good mornings as well  it d keep the weight ON my back in the same spot as before with the same weight as before       I genuinely think that workout was so hard it scared my body into healing  because I was able to return to squatting again for the next workout   I was in pain  sure  and I had to take the squats slow  but I wasn t missing any reps     And then  like an idiot  I forgot the lessons I had learned about hydration and keeping my legs warm and  without my morning Gatorade and sweats  went and TORE my hamstring this time on rep 20   Yup  that was workout 7     Back on the good mornings  but this time the hamstring was so borked I couldn t get the weight that I needed to for progression   I got hurt with 345  and 350 wasn t stable  so I warmed up until I felt the hamstring start to buckle and went for  max rep GMs   https   www youtube com watch v 2tcuISpN63w      So now Chaos really IS the plan  5lb progressions between workouts just ceased   What is one to do   Well  the middle of that good morning workout and my next squat workout  Thanksgiving happened  which meant I had to  pull 401 reps with 135lbs on a high handle trap bar in a single set   https   www youtube com watch v JWkSz QEtSk      Because traditions damnit     Next Super Squats workout  all my hamstring would tolerate was 315lbs  so I went and took it for a ride and only managed 16 reps before I could feel it start to buckle and bulge   So I got to yes by racking the bar  trying 1 more rep  hitting my pullovers  and then immediately getting pissed off  strip the bar to 245lbs and get my 20 reps in   Mission absolutely accomplished  Please note my use of knee wraps to hold my hamstring in place together  as that would be in effect for the remainder of the program      and with THAT  the new way forward began   We had finished workout 9  which was halfway through the program  and a new plan emerged  take 315 for as many reps as possible   Which is TOTALLY in line with something the book discussed about dudes going for 30 reps with breathing squats  Chaos is the plan  and we moved forward with that plan      and comically enough  people STILL asked me what I was planning    Are you going to stick with 315 or eventually up the weight    This whole run of SS could NOT be any more an indication of  Chaos is the Plan    And I M SO thankful that I embraced that from the start   If I set out with a goal to squat 405 for 20  I d just be miserable with how this whole experience turned out  and probably would have shut it all down at the halfway point when I  failed  to add 5lbs   Instead  I got to experience the most challenging run of Super Squats perhaps EVER performed  afflicted with RSV for about half of it  through torn muscles  adding a rep each session and nearly blacking out from effort  with some Bruce Randall good mornings for good measure   This is the Chaos edition of Super Squats  and it s amazing     For those that want to watch the whole process   here is the youtube playlist  https   www youtube com watch v  xRsOupFXRk list PLfcuGAffLlSdHGXZa4ER6fRyj 7FrJPuy     MY SPECIFIC TRAINING PLAN      The very first time I ran the program 15 years ago  I did an abbreviated approach  because that was all the rage then   This time  I wanted to stay pretty close to what the book laid out   I did no calf work  and my ab work was standing ab wheel  but for the most part I stuck with the program laid out in the book while employing the exercises listed       I created two separate training days  A and B  and rotated between them every training day  3x a week   Do  for example  Week 1 would go A B A  week 2 B A B  repeat   This got me a little bit of variety and allowed me to have some extra recovery between sessions of SLDL   They broke down as such     DAY A      Axle clean and strict press 3x10 superset with 50 band pull aparts    Weighted dips 3x12 superset with axle bent over rows 2x15    Breathing squats 1x20 pull overs 1x20    Axle Straight Legged Deadlifts 1x15    Poundstone curls  1 rep more than previous workout each time     DAY B      Incline DB bench 3x12 superset with 2x15 weighted chins    Behind the neck press 3x10 superset with 50 band pull aparts    Breathing squats 1x20 pull overs 1x20    Kroc rows 1xmax reps    Axle shrugs against bands 1xmax reps    Reverse hyper 1x50  reps    Once this portion of the workout was finished  I d drink a protein shake  a PROTEIN shake you philistines  NOT a carb fat shake   It was egg whites mixed with a scoop of protein powder   and then finish up with 20 reps of standing ab wheel  30 glute ham raises  25 push downs  band curls on day B  and then some manner of 3 5 minutes of conditioning       On top of this  daily  I d do either 5 minutes of kettlebell armor building complexes w 24kg bells or the  TABEARTA  workout of Barbell bear complexes with 95lbs getting in 3 complexes per round     In between Super Squats workouts  to include the two day break on the weekends   I d do conditioning workouts   I initially was a little cute and creative  but pretty quickly I settled into a rut of something I referred to as  Armor Bearer    which looked like this   https   www youtube com watch v 11wjg0LBbQw      An  Armor Bearer  is 5 minutes of Dan John s kettlebell  Armor Building Complex   2 cleans  1 press  3 front squats  followed immediately with TABEARTA  tabata protocol Bear complexes w 95lbs        Just 1 round of these can absolutely nuke you if you really push it  for me  that s getting around 25 ABCs and a full 8 rounds of 3 complexes with the bears   but for the Tuesday workout I d typically do 3 rounds of these   Weekends would be 1 3 rounds   On Thursdays  I d end up doing something slightly less aggressive  like a circuit of swings  thrusters and burpee chins or something similar   Basically  I d recover recharge over the weekends  come out hard     Mon through Wed  and need a slight dip down in intensity on Thurs to be able to absolutely smash Friday     On Tues and Thurs  I d train fasted   I feel like that s better for nutrient partitioning post workout   For the Super Squats workouts  I had half a low carb bagel with sunflower seed butter pre workout for the first half of the program  switching to a slice of homemade sourdough toast with sunflower butter for the second half because my wife took up making sourdough and it s amazing     Oh yeah  one other thing  I was STILL training first thing in the morning for all of these workouts   Typically around 0400     What s worth appreciating is that I realize this violates Super Squats recommendation of resting as much as possible between the workouts  but it SHOULD be noted that this DOES represent a significant reduction in training volume for me   Instead of 40 60 minute conditioning workouts  I was doing 10 30   Instead of 10 20 minute conditioning workouts post lifting  it was 3 5   I was sleeping more  and the volume within the lifting workouts itself was on the lower side   This program will STILL beat you down  no matter who you are  and it DOES require throttling back to recover     NUTRITION      It would be WAY too tedious to document what I was eating  because I am a constant grazer as it is and this program just turned my appetite up to 11   But I ll say that was probably the biggest thing  I stopped restricting myself and just ate if I felt any hunger   I still stuck with Deep Water Mountain Dogg approved stuff for the vast majority of my nutrition  but was a bit more willing to eat  off menu  here and there   I maintained a focus on food quality  and didn t need to resort to  dirty  eating to get in my calories   Between avocados  nuts and nut sunflower seed butter  it s pretty easy to jack up calories  and mixed in with a variety of animal based protein sources and some keto magic breads tortillas  I was in a good way   My dirtiest daily item was a protein bar keto bar  which is also one of the first things I cut out of a diet when I m no longer gaining     Biggest meals were always my post training breakfast and my pre bed time meal   Eating before bed remains one of the most effective strategies I know for gaining  and I love starting the day off with a win by smashing a VERY large and nutritious breakfast     RESULTS      As much as it upsets people  I don t weigh myself  and I took no before after photos       But what WAS amazing was how I was just smashing lifts every time I trained on this program   I imagine coming into it with a LOT of accumulated volume and finally taking the time to laser focus it into an abbreviated approach really paid off  especially when paired with a LOT of food   I m not an excel ninja  so I m just going to spell out the progress I had     Axle clean and strict press went from 3x10x136 to 2x10x171 and 1x9x171  so close    Behind the neck press from 3x10x95 to 3x10x135  Weighted dips went from 3x12x55 to 3x12x100 and weighted chins from 2x15x7 5lbs to 2x15x20lbs keeping in mind I gained bodyweight through the program   DB bench from 3x12x80s to 3x12x105s  Axle rows went from 2x15x193 to 2x15x228  Axle SLDLs went from 15x243 to 15x283  doing them AFTER the squats is just awful   Kroc rows from 15x115 to 23x115    And  of course  Breathing Squats from 20x315 to 30x315 WITH a recovering torn hamstring    LEESSONS LEARNED      The squats themselves are immaterial  it s more about the loading of the body and hard effort   In turn  the  5lbs per week  is also immaterial   Good mornings and increasing reps proved viable  and I m sure there is much more room to play around with   But that s why we run these programs  we learned lessons like that that we can carry forward     If you re not drinking the gallon of milk a day  you ll have to eat like it s your job   I really would have preferred to just suck down a gallon a day and eat normally vs the sheer volume of food I was putting away   I legit felt like I had been hit by a bomb through weeks 3 and 4  and finally managed to get a handle on things toward the end     If we wait until we feel good  we ll never train   I tore my hamstring before I was halfway done with the program  and up until the final workout it still ached   It hurt LESS  sure  but I could still make an argument that I was injured at the final workout  And if I waited until I was  ready  to start again  I have no idea how long that would have taken   Instead  I  went before I was ready   squatted through pain  used knee wraps to fake a hamstring  took things slow  etc   I genuinely do not feel I slowed down my healing rate in doing so  if anything  I sped it up  because I kept the muscle moving and gave it fresh blood   In addition  I had zero  break back in  period   Often  people that get injured and rest take FOREVER to get back because  upon their return  they ll try out the movement that hurt them and still experience some pain in doing so  and they ll freak out and go back to resting   My continuing in my training  I effectively did my own rehab  getting the muscle from completely worthless to almost 100  functional  and didn t miss any training as a result     BONUS SUPER SQUATS RAMBLING       NOTE  What is written below are some jumbled thoughts I came up with toward the middle of my Super Squats run  so the timeline of thought processes may seem  off      Going beyond 20 reps has been such a different way to make this program awful  and I feel like it just compliments things so well   Just by nature of my injury I ended up doing 2 weeks of going up 5lbs a workout before resetting the weight to the start and then going up one REP a workout  and both progression models seem to work out pretty well   I feel like there s something to doing this intentional   Perhaps running the program for 3 weeks where you go up 5lbs per workout  then reset and push max reps   Another approach would be do 1 week going up 5 reps per workout  then hold that weight for the next week and go up a rep per workout and keep alternating that way   A way to slow down the weight increases while still making things suck   You might even do 10lb jumps during the weight increase weeks to compensate for the  down time    Another option would be 6 weeks one way  6 weeks the other  with a program in the middle of course       And then there s alternate MOVEMENTS to include in there   I ve demonstrated that  at least ONE workout of  Super Good Mornings  is viable   It d be interesting to see what a full cycle would be like   I also know that the book talks about hip belt squats  and from there the trap bar is a very logical transition   And then we can combine that all with the above   What about a week of good mornings where we progress weights  next week we take that top weight of good mornings and make it a squat week where we re chasing after max reps  and then next week is a trap bar week   Are we making conjugate Super Squats   It s a bit like Dogg Crapp  which  actually  would ALSO work just dandy here  change between 3 movements every workout     I ve also entertained the idea of being cute and having a theme of  Paul Kelso Super Squats    Use the trap bar for presses  rows  trap bar lifts and SLDLs   I m literally thinking AS I write this and I realize I just came up with a  potentially  INCREDIBLY effective hypertrophy program with ONE piece of equipment and NO rack   Just think of how space economic that is   Biggest issue would be getting the trap bar in place for pressing without a rack  but that circus act CAN happen   And using radar chest pulls  you don t need a bench and dumbbell to get the pull over effect       All THIS said  I REALLY don t think the SSB meets intent here at all   I feel like a BIG part of the  success  of this program Is having that bar just absolutely CRUSH you for all it s worth and you just survive for as long as possible   The SSB is too comfortable AND it allows you to stand there and take the pressure off of you by pushing it back or pulling it forward as needed   You are ON the clock when it s a barbell crushing you  and even with the trap bar with straps  you re still standing there having it pull your shoulders out of the socket   Don t ask me about the belt squat  I have no idea how that s supposed to work     I DO have to avoid for falling into the trap of making Super Squats the answer to everything   I have to appreciate that this laser focused program was effective BECAUSE I came into it with SO much accumulated volume   In that regard  I plan to do a write up at some point of Super Squats and Deep Water being yin and yang   Both absolutely crazy  but SO different in their insanity  making them ideal pairings   3 days a week of 1x20 vs 1 day a week of 10x10   Of course  the kind of dude that is just plain ALWAYS running Super Squats and Deep Water back to back is too crazy even for me   At some point there would need to be some sort of OTHER side of balance  which would probably be a great time for a lighter 5 3 1 program  the 10K swing challenge  or something else just plain wildly different ,,

me the courage to share my progress  Bit nervous but my hope is that my results  and the things I did both right and wrong  can provide a more  average dude  sort of view  I m not jacked  I m not swole  I can t bench 5 plates  but I feel I ve made decent progress despite some wasted time along the way  I m always up for discussion on fitness  I ve learned a lot but always have more to learn    nbsp     Photos     Before   300lbs  https   i imgur com rSFCsed jpg    Progress   down to 183  https   i imgur com 6fQP5cz jpg    Current   195 200  https   i imgur com PlKXC7u jpg    nbsp     My 20s and 30s    A call center job chained to a desk  along with moving to a big city and eating amazing food  caused me to balloon from my teenage size to 300 lbs in my 20s  At my worst  I was eating  4000 calories of trash a day  with no real veggies and very little protein  A typical breakfast was a stop at 7 11 for an extra large iced mocha latte  two donuts and three deep fried taquitos  I would snack all day on Doritos and Dr Pepper  A typical supper was a 1200cal chicken parm sub  I had severe sleep apnea  various bowel issues  fucked up knees  constant back pain  rashes  irritated eyes and nose  I was a walking heart attack    nbsp     Initial Weight Loss    This is where the  mistakes were made  meme comes in  at least according to current wisdom  In 2015 at age 35 I went to the doctor  who determined that a  my blood pressure was moments away from a stroke and b  in her heavy French accent   we found some diabetes  in my blood work  I asked her what to do  and thankfully she did not give me pills  but said  lose weight   I said I would   Had a little cry in the car  and decided then and there to change   It gets dicey here  because I googled the whole diabetes thing  and it sure seemed like sugar and simple carbs were to blame  Rather than take a reasonable approach  I dove head long into Paleo  religious fervor and all  The good news  Cutting out carbs had immediate effect  and  felt easy   in that meals were still enjoyable  By pure willpower and my new belief that  all sugar was poison   I quit everything else cold turkey  Drank water only  no more snacks  no more pop  nothing  I tracked everything with MyFitnessPal  which I still preach to this day  even if temporarily  to see where you re at   My daily caloric intake went down into the 1300 1500 calorie range  And I was very  very consistent   The weight melted off  As I m sure many would agree  too fast  30 lbs in 2 weeks  50 60 in about 3 months  From April to November I went from 300 lbs to 190  My only physical activity was walking  EVERY SINGLE DAY  no matter what  at least one hour  often two  Podcasts probably saved my life  Eventually  I worked my way up to jogging and then to running  Zero lifting  Most joint pain went away  bowels started working right  rashes and itchiness and disappeared  I  cured  the pre diabetes  got my BP under control  After maintaining my weight for four years  I retired my CPAP machine  Went from a 44 waist to 32  2XL shirts to Medium   So this may all sound amazing  but the low carb stuff and severe calorie restriction damaged my relationship with food and I still struggle a bit today  I m happy to discuss this further in the comments   Also  because I didn t lift  I lost a ton of muscle  and looked kinda gaunt and flabby  see  pic of me in the red t shirt   I badly pulled my quad helping a friend move a couch  and realized I might ve made some mistakes    nbsp     Starting Lifting    Strength training began in late 2016 after talking with some friends about it  At first I just bought a shitty weight set for home and randomly did exercises  poorly  Eventually I got to talking with my friend Brandon  who s also an online S C coach  and we started on a very beginner friendly Functional Fitness program  I know that term has been beaten to death in online fitness over the years but considering my numerous mobility and joint issues  it was the right call  Simple bodyweight exercises to improve mobility  hip hinge drills  squat holds  T spine mobility   lots of isometric work to build core strength  planks  dead bugs   and most importantly  work to strengthen my back using Stuart McGill s  Big 3     nbsp     Trail Running    While beginning this  I still felt that I  needed  to run  My knees felt good  I moved up North and out to the country  and got further into trail running  This culminated in competing in my first race  a 7km trail run at Limberlost Forest  This is where my coach helped me understand that you don t need to run miles a day to have  decent  conditioning  he insisted I not go out and  run 7km every day   Instead  we did sprint drills on my rest days  10sec on  20sec off  as well as hill sprints  To my surprise  I felt good during the race and finished 77th out of 200  entries   It also made me realize that I don t really like running  and I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it  So I haven t really gotten back into it since  The iron suits me better    nbsp     Current Training    Because I started in my late 30s after 15yrs of destroying my body  there s a heavy focus on warm up and mobility work  Some on this sub might see it as busy work or junk volume  but it s all in the service of staying pain free OR working around minor aches and pains  and improving on my limitations  I care about that more than I care about numbers on the bar  I don t back squat  for example  I either front squat or KB squat  There s a lot of Dan John and Mike Boyle influence   The other day when I was sitting in a deep  long squat at work  a co worker was asking me wtf I was doing  I said  I m squatting like this at 42 so I can squat like this at 82    Since I began weight training  I have missed zero training days  ZERO  In many cases I ve delayed one by a day  and I ve worked through and around minor injuries and sickness  When I travel I bring a kettlebell and I get work done  I ve also lifted with COVID  perks of a home gym  No matter what  above all else  CONSISTENCY  Good workout  shit workout  just TRAIN  80  effort the rest of your life is better than 100  effort half the time   My current program consists of four 4 week blocks  First block is high rep work  second block is ramping reps  third block increases RPE  ramping upward each week  and fourth block ramps heavy maxes  no more than 5 reps on most lifts  Full body 3x a week  I feel this suits me because I have no specific goals  and I don t compete  I have no idea what my 1RMs are and don t really care  I just want to progress  The programming is vaguely powerlifting based  in that each day focuses on Bench  Deadlift  or Squat  but my coach is a kettlebell fiend  and I ve fallen in love with them as well  so they factor in as often as the barbell   I don t want to make the post even bigger than it already is  so I don t think I should post the entire program  But here s an example of this week  which is ramping RPE and includes complimentary plyo movements in a Giant Set    nbsp     Warmups       MBSC Flow Warmup  https   www youtube com watch v Brjs42oQ7FU t 2s    Box Jumps  Side Planks

depending on what I want to do  and also weather  I often like to do heavy farmer s carries  bodyweight or more  to failure or sled pushes in the summer  In the winter I stick mostly to kettlebell complexes and just try and wear myself out   Rest days are for active rest  I walk my dog daily  I do a ton of hiking and kayaking  and I m thinking about buying a bike  I also work in auto parts so I spend most of my day on my feet  walking around a warehouse carrying things   If I had to bro guess my lifts  based on 5 rep maxes   they re around 385 on the deadlift  190 200 bench  and 200 on the front squat    nbsp     Nutrition    As mentioned before  my diet lost a ton of weight  but really messed with my eating habits   After I hit my goal  I simply reintroduced more calories  but after lots of reading and getting to know the science better  I dropped the Paleo and started eating carbs again  But I STILL  feared carbs   and tended to not eat as much as I should  I was sort of permanently hovering around 2000 calories until last year  worried about putting weight back on  worried about the bathroom scale  worried about carbs  I was always cold  I felt great in terms of strength and energy though   My coach finally convinced me to just not look at the scale  and try to eat a bit more intuitively  The result  I gained like 1 lb over the course of a year  while recomping muscle a bit and looking better  Lifts went up  After that  we talked about adding more calories  mostly carbs  From my lowest weight of 183  first shirtless pic   I ve put on about 15 pounds  some of which I sure hope is muscle  last pic   If and when my pants get tight  I ll probably cut again  After all  I ve done it before   I really do consider my nutrition a strength now  I try not to track anymore  hovering around 2600 2800 calories  I shoot for 0 7 0 8g lb of protein  which means 170 180g  I fill the rest in with carbs and fat  moreso carbs now  which is where I was lacking before  Breakfast every day is a protein shake with a scoop of whey isolate  spinach  fruit of some kind  creatine  and unsweetened almond milk  and a bowl of oatmeal  I meal prep lunches EVERY  SINGLE  SUNDAY no matter what  Lunch is 40 50g of protein  usually chicken or ground turkey  roasted potatoes or rice  and a veg like Broccoli  Small protein bar for a snack every single day  a cup of plain Greek yogurt most days  sometimes with chocolate chips or berries in it  Suppers are where I let loose and play around  I love to cook  but at their core is always 40 50g of protein  I try to keep red meat to once a week  usually a lean cut of steak  Post workout dinners are often big breakfast plates with 3 4 eggs  egg whites  turkey bacon  roasted potatoes and a good multi grain bread with peanut butter  To  get my carbs in  now  I ll have another bowl of oatmeal or a PB J sandwich   I drink only black coffee and water  I eat three big meals and two or three snacks every day  But I ve also learned to live a little  my healthy habits are firmly in place so it s okay to eat junk now and then  A latte every now and then  a restaurant a couple times a month  usually a big breakfast   Occasionally a Halo Top ice cream  If I want a cookie or a donut  I have one  I still try to keep cheap snacks out of the house to prevent binging  if I want a treat  I have to go to the bakery and get a treat  Make it worth it   I would say these are the four biggest tips I could give on nutrition  track what you eat  at LEAST for the first few months   have the occasional snack  don t drink your calories  and MEAL PREP  You  can  do a huge caloric deficit like I did and succeed  and then go back to eating somewhat normally  but most will fail in that   Better to consistently reinforce good habits and drop the weight more slowly  For others  simply focusing on becoming stronger and more mobile while eating  a bit better  can be enough  More protein  more fibre  less junk    nbsp     Mental Health  Body Image    This is still a daily struggle for me  even though I do feel some pride in what I accomplished  I struggle with anxiety  and looking back it was obvious I stress ate  I ve replaced the food with behavioural therapy  and trying to just relax more  get out in nature  get off social media  read more books   I have loose skin  but as you can see in the pics it s not too bad now that I ve put some muscle on  If I bend over  it still looks like melted cheese  but if I m standing up  I have abs and my obliques even show up a little  I think since I started eating enough  my shoulders  chest and even traps have come in a little  My quads have grown very noticeably  and my wife says  I have an ass now   But body dysmorphia is real and I still think  I m getting too fat  or  my arms aren t big enough   I just keep telling myself that consistency is all that matters  Show up and do the damn thing  I owe a lot to my coach  keeping me grounded and keeping my workouts interesting and challenging  I look forward to training   I do this for overall fitness  health and well being  I do this so I can still be moving and active and healthy in my 80s  I m mostly pain free and I now have the knowledge to stay that way  I look  move and feel better at 42 than I did at 22   It also encouraged my wife to eat better and exercise  and she s lost about 40 lbs from her heaviest  I couldn t be more proud of her   I m happy to answer further questions in the comments  Thanks for listening to my rambling ,,

10p4u5ppost,10p4u5p,,Pejorativez,2023-01-30 14:59:43,Does overtraining exist? (research review),https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/10p4u5p/,570.0,298.0,     Intro    Not everyone thinks overtraining is real  Public personalities such as CT Fletcher and the late Rich Piana spoke against the existence of overtraining     You may have heard phrases such as        More is better      Push yourself to your limits      There is no such thing as overtraining  only under recovery     Even coaches question the existence of overtraining        I haven t seen anyone experience  overtraining    2      Is it overtraining or just work ethic    2   These claims hold some truth  Indeed  it is very hard to become overtrained  also known as overtraining syndrome  It mostly happens to elite athletes  It is rare in strength training and bodybuilding  1   7    Many scientific studies describe overtraining syndrome in athletes  1   4   5   6   7   9   Estimates suggest 20  to 60  of athletes may become overtrained at some point in their career  4          What overtraining is    Overtraining is when you ve pushed your body too hard for too long  1   4   5   6   7   9    In practice  you experience a drop in physical performance and fatigue  4   7   9   11      There are two things that lead to overtraining     1  Excessive exercise  for example  intense training every day  7    2  Under recovery  not enough food  water  physical rest  mental rest and sleep  7   9    You need to do both of these for months  maybe years  until overtraining develops   In other words  overtraining is all about balance  or the lack of it        Under recovery  not just over training    While it may seem contradictory  overtraining doesn t have to come exclusively from excessive exercise   Under recovery  means eating  sleeping or resting too little  It also includes mental stress   So if you do not recover properly  you may end up  under recovered         Will I become overtrained     I think the  r fitness wiki  answers this well  https   thefitness wiki faq am i overtraining    No   The risk of overtraining syndrome is low  You are more likely to become overreached or non functionally overreached  The symptoms during overreaching are the same as during overtraining  fatigue  drop in performance  and so on   The ones who are at a real risk of overtraining  are elite athletes  It could happen to a normal person  but that person would have to train daily  intensively  for months and years        Conclusion    Overtraining syndrome exists  but you are not likely to be affected by it   If you recover with 1 4 weeks of rest  you are overreaching  If you need 4  weeks of recovery  you may be overtrained    Source  https   sci fit net overtraining myths         References    1  Bell L  Ruddock A  Maden Wilkinson T  Rogerson D  Overreaching and

 www reddit com r Fitness     This is my first post here  even though I have been reading watching fitness content for almost 8 years now  I have a passion for fitness and my goal is to have an aesthetic lean and healthy body  I am 28 years old  male  184 cm  and at around 80 kg right now  6 0   and 176 lbs for fellow Americans   I know this journey is a long one and I am not claiming I know much  so happy to get any feedback from you guys   PHOTOS  apologies for the bad 2015 photo quality     Before and After Side  https   imgur com a QAd8jx8    Before and After Front  https   imgur com a m9AgD2E    Before and After Back  https   imgur com a NgsWSFS   HIGH PROTEIN DIET BUT NO SERIOUS LIFTING  2015 2019    While studying at university  I had casually started going to the gym with my buddies  learning a bit about nutrition and working out  I gradually understood the importance of protein and calorie intake  progressive overload  rest and sleep  having a routine and being disciplined  With ups and downs  I would have periods when I would focus more on my workouts and stressful periods where I would not progress at all because I would not spend much time at the gym  I was around 86 88 kg for the whole period and my aim was to lose 5 6 kg  build some muscle and become more fit   HOME WORKOUTS COVID  2020   During the COVID 19 lockdowns  having plenty of free time  I started working out at home  mainly doing pushups and when I had access to some outdoors bars I would do pull ups leg raises dips  When I went back home and I had access to the sea I would also go swimming almost every day  Nothing crazy  just for 10 15 minutes   2021 2022 GYMS REOPEN  In 2021  I would casually go back to the gym  more chilled with my nutrition  enjoying desserts and fatty foods here and there  I would walk for at least 1 hour a day  commute and back  so I would still lose some weight and finally become around 80 82 kg   2023 FITNESS BECOMES PRIORITY  This January I decided to sign up to a new gym with a sauna  swimming pool and steam room and accepted a challenge by a friend on who can become most ripped over the next year or so  So I started reading in various subreddits on what I should do  realising at around 80 kg I need to lean bulk up first and then cut  something I never actually did  at least on purpose   So I am back into reading about workouts and nutrition  using the sauna after my morning workouts as it makes me feel good and trying to bulk in a proper way  eating healthy foods   PROGRAM  I chose to mix compound exercises with isolation exercises so that each day is focused around at least one main muscle group  One of the reasons I am posting this is to get feedback about my program  I feel like I started with a proper program and over the years I customised it so many times so that I am adaptable to what s available in the gym and to what I feel like doing on that day  I work out 6 7 days a week so I am targeting most muscle groups more than once in a week  For most exercises  I would have a dynamic warm up first  small or no weight  and then start the actual sets  Over time  I am increasing the weight  to achieve progressive overload or add extra reps sets in my workout   I occasionally have an intense 15 minute ab workout with very small breaks  targeting upper abs  lower abs and obliques   Day 1   Chest  4 x  8 reps    Barbell Bench Press  from just the bar warm up to 90kg   4 x  8 reps    Dips with just bodyweight  4x  8 reps    Dumbbell Incline Bench Press  up to 34 kg per hand   3x  8 reps    Cable fly from above  3x  8 reps    Cable fly from mid height  3x  8 reps    Cable fly from low height  Day 2  Back  6x  6 8 reps  Pull Ups  just bodyweight   3x  8 reps    Dumbbell Row  16 kg each hand separately   3x  8 reps    Barbell Row  up to 50 kg   4x  8 reps   Lat pulldown machines  Day 3   Legs  5x  8 10 reps  Romanian Deadlifts  up to 80 kg   4x  8 10 reps  Squats    up to 60 kg      need to increase this  EDIT  90kg recorded  myself  https   imgur com LCIlqyD  this morning feeling energetic and after reading comments was not afraid to increase weight  let me know what you think of the form   4x  8 10 reps  Leg Extensions  45 kg   4x  8 10 reps  Leg Curl  around 25 kg   Day 4   Shoulders Biceps Triceps  4x  8 reps  Barbell Overhead press  up to 50 kg   5x  8 reps  Dumbbell Side lateral raise  up to 12 kg per hand   4x  8 reps     front raises with a 15 kg round weight  4x  8 reps    Hammer Curls  up to 16 kg per hand   4x  8 reps    Dumbbell Bicep Curls  up to 20 kg per hand   4x  8 reps    Tricep Extensions  up to 10 kg per hand   4x  8 reps    Tricep Dips  just bodyweight   4x  8 reps  rear delt fly  small weight   e g  5 kg   DIET  I started tracking macros and calories via MyNetDiary  I use my apple watch which is synced with the app to adjust the calorie budget depending on my daily activity  Working out every day  I need around 3 3k kcal for maintenance or 3 5k kcal for a 0 5 kg gain per month  I use the rule of thumb of having up to 2g of protein for each kg of my body weight  so my goal is to have around 160g of protein every day  I prefer foods low on saturated fats and I minimise red meat consumption  The macro split on a typical day would be 20  protein  20  fat and 60  carbs  I find this well balanced with my goals and the high amount of carbs makes me feel energetic in my workouts  This is still my first week tracking so I need to do some trial and error so that I achieve the desired result   My most popular meals are  I would sometimes have breakfast lunch twice in a day    Breakfast   44g protein 580kcal  Protein scoop  55g oats  50g blueberries  one banana  100g 5  fage Greek yoghurt  Lunch   54g protein 630kcal 250g Brown rice  microwaved for 2 mins    220g chicken breast  Dinner  Homemade pizza  47g protein 1000kcal   SUPPLEMENTS  Whey vegan protein powder and protein bars to boost protein intake  and coffee for pre workout     END  Thank you for spending your time reading all this  I know I had very slow progress in the first few years with almost non existent progress until 2020  but I think what matters is the way forward  so happy to hear your thoughts  Writing this was helpful for me  gathering my thoughts and reflecting on areas to improve  I am the happiest I have even been and feeling healthy and confident with my body  and this was not always the case  I hope this can help others in their own journeys     x200B   EDIT  Updated squat weight and added link to  video  https   imgur com LCIlqyD

10qpp3lj6rh9ip,10qpp3l,j6rh9ip,[deleted],2023-02-01 11:15:11,,,137.0,,I ve told a few wrestling related stories here that people seem to like    I m a professional wrestler  Been doing it many years  trained under a lot of UK WWE guys    This past weekend I was asked if I would step in at my school and run the beginners class which I ve done a few times before  Now the world of wrestling is fucking weird  especially at the lower end of it  you might some real odd people   So I go into the class and there s a new guy  big older dude  very overweight but this is pro wrestling  big overweight dudes are actually quite a draw  My first immediate red flag though is when we shakes my hand and says  call me Hero  whilst pointing to a tattoo on his forearm of  Hero  underlined with a katana  The way this guy was talking was like he was already a wrestler but when I asked him how much experience he has he was very vague  wouldn t give a time frame would just say  I ve had a few matches over the years   But whatever  it s beginners  anyone can join in  So I tell him to get stuck in with the rest of the class and help set the ring up  the ring for those that don t know is essentially a metal frame  wooden boards  a bit of padding and a canvas  nothing spectacular but Hero is stood around loudly making comments to no one in particular like  ahhh wooden ring boards  that takes me back   So this dude is trying to hint he s some form of wrestling vet  Ring is set up  we do a bit of a warm up  do some fitness stuff which he struggles through but again  it s beginners  not expecting physical peak performance  did think it was odd that a wrestling  vet  couldn t do 100 squats  This is where I start losing my shit  We line up by the ring  two lines either side  I plan a very simple sequence  both wrestlers come in  one grabs the other  hits their head on the turnbuckle  pulls them out  whip into the ropes  clothesline  The one who got clotheslined rolls out  next person comes in and grabs the one in the ring and go again  That s it  that s all I want  Hero gets in  another guy gets in  again beginners  Hero grabs the other guy and without warning fucking gives him this big forearm smash right to the side of the head  I was like  what the fuck was that    And he goes  well that s what my character would have done  and I told him  not in fucking beginners he doesn t  do the sequence as I explained it   I made him leave the ring  checked on the other guy  he was fine luckily   So it s Hero s turn again  this time he s paired up with a girl who s about 100lbs lighter than him  she s the one grabbing him and doing all the moves  she grabs him and Hero just pushes her off and grabs her  I tell them to stop and ask  what are you doing     well she s so much smaller than me  my character would just reverse it  again I tell him  just do the sequence exactly as I said    The girl grabs him  hits him into the turnbuckle  pulls him out  goes to send him of but he refuses to move  he then pushes her arm away  grabs her and puts her into a bodyslam position  I had to literally jump in and grab her legs because he was about to dump her onto her fucking head  it was like trying to wrestle a chew toy away from a dog  put her down    I lost my shit  again  what the fuck are you doing    I just wanted to add something to make it make sense  I just told him to get the fuck out of the ring and stay out until he learns to listen  Which is unlike me  I like to keep my classes light and fun but this prick was going to kill someone  He tells me he s going to the toilets real quick and he never came back thank god ,,

coordination through primary and high school  I did the usual sports that an Australian boy growing up near the coast did through high school   bodyboarding  swimming  cricket  touch footy   but none to a high level or competitively    The gym seemed weird  scary  and full of unintellectual  bros   but I first stepped inside when I realised that swimming wasn t going to get me jacked by itself  I was pretty inconsistent when I first started  doing a mix of Starting Strength  exercise classes  and a program my first trainer had written me             Years 1 2  Greyskull LP  Candito s LP

progression for the first year  mainly Greyskull and Candito s Linear Progression  When progressing from session to session got hard  I moved to a basic linear periodization program with Candito s 6 Week for squats and deadlifts and Stronger By Science s 2x Med Int Bench for bench  duh     After a couple of years in 2018  I entered  a novice comp and totaled 455kg  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments 6tdxmb meet report ptc winter improvers comp sydney nsw   at around 89kg  but I was still pretty clueless about lifting technique and programming  A prime example   I trained on a 25kg squat bar for most of my prep without realising  then was very confused when squats seemed extremely light in competition  I also trained on a deadlift bar and bumpers  then almost missed my opening deadlift on comp plates because all my projected maxes were off    I thought I knew a lot about technique from watching and reading a lot  but clearly my lifts were pretty bad  I was pulling sumo because it felt easier on my lower back  but that was just because I hadn t figured out how to hinge yet      Diet    I aimed for about 1 5 grams of protein per kilo of bodyweight  and didn t pay too much attention to carbs and fats as long as I hit my daily calories  I also didn t worry about vegetables and nutrients  During this time  I dialled my drinking back a little  but I was still drinking very heavily one night a week while partying with my buddies and seeing music  Overall  my compliance with my calorie targets was around 65 70  and my recovery was pretty poor       Years 3 4  GZCL  SSPT  Average to Savage 1 0    Weight   89 103 96kg                   Squat   210kg     Bench   135kg     Deadlift    235kg      Training    I started to branch out more into some longer linear periodisation via GZCL s Jacked and Tan 2 0 and The Rippler  then tried out a  more specific powerlifting program SSPT  https   www reddit com r powerlifting comments 7wix39 program review sspt high

picked up  Average to Savage 1 0  https   www reddit com r AverageToSavage comments 98wzzk average to savage 3x medium int aka bench more to    a simple linear periodisation program  and started cycling that consistently while working in some more bench volume  I competed and  set a 580kg total at 103kg around the 3 4 year mark  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments da9tk1 meet report top lifter iv sydney nsw australia      I still had no idea what I was doing  technique wise  and managed to pull something in my lower back from a poorly executed AMRAP on some sumo deadlifts  Apart from that  I was fairly injury free apart from niggles      Diet    I completed my first cut from 95kg to around 90kg  before bulking up and breaking the 100kg barrier for a competition  From memory  my calorie consumption peaked around 3 900 or so  I still wasn t paying attention to macros other than protein  and my compliance was still around 65 70   I moved in with my girlfriend  however  and that meant I started to dial back the partying and alcohol consumption       Years 5 Now  A Coach  More Volume  Squatting Every Day  Sandbags  PRs    Weight   96 105 93 100 93                   Squat   220kg     Bench   155kg     Deadlift   270kg      Training    A few weeks before my meet in 2019  I got talking to a guy at the gym squatting 240kg with ease  Turns out he was a coach  and told me I should be much stronger than I am because my technique sucked  I figured he was right  so I hired him to handle my training and nutrition    We spent a lot of time focusing on my technique  building weak points  squatting high bar  pulling conventional  and getting better at benching  I even spent about 8 months squatting using a Bulgarian program  which was good fun until I got sick of squatting to a max every day  I did learn a lot about fatigue  skill practice  and how to grind  and put 55kg on my high bar squat    In general  we did a lot more volume overall  about 25  more than before across main lifts and assistance  We spent more time in the 1 5 rep range for my main lifts while we pushed assistance to up to 20 reps  We focused a lot on incline pressing and pec work  chest flies   hamstring and glute work  good mornings and back extensions   and back work of all kinds  In general  the goal was to get me technically better  bigger  more jacked  and more resilient to injury    COVID hit during this time  so I bought some sandbags  trained in my basement carpark  and set some all time deadlift and squat PRs  which you can read about  here  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments h8oilo enter the sandman 8 weeks of sandbag training    During the second wave  I did the same thing  but was limited by some knee issues that cropped up    I also took more of an interest in anatomy and biomechanics by taking A ustralian Strength Coach s Strength System Certification  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments mgc4xv course review strength system certification level    which was a course that covered anatomy  program design  technique  and rest and recovery  While the programming wasn t ground breaking for me  my coach has very similar programming philosophies as Sebastian Oreb   I found the anatomy portions very useful to start thinking about movements in more detail    When things opened back up  I competed again in 2021  setting a  603kg total at 104kg  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments jwmkui meet report paragon open sydney nsw aus 603kg    then most recently  a  622 5kg total at 100kg at the end of last year   https   www reddit com r weightroom comments 104gbqb meet report strength tribe end of year send   I then cut down to 93kg in time for my wedding so I could look lean AF and good in a suit      Diet    My diet shifted here   my coach got me on a high carb  low fat  moderate protein approach  This looked like 180 200gm protein  40 70gm fat  depending on whether I was bulking or cutting   and the rest into carbs  The biggest thing that changed was the volume of food  To get to 105kg  we needed to go as high as 5 000 calories per day  which was a mental amount of food  I think one day  I hit 800gm of carbs  At the depths of the cut  we got to 2 400 cals    Over these years  I got much better at adherence to calorie targets  hitting 90 100  consistently   I also got much better at nutrient quality and getting in fruits and veggies while still having flexibility in the kitchen as I like to cook  I developed my own system of shopping and food prep which I m happy to write about if people are interested    As an example  a typical day might look like    Breakfast     Two cups oats  200gm greek yoghurt  1 cup mixed berries  1 tbsp golden syrup with added water  blended into a smoothie    Lunch     200gm kangaroo mince  200gm capsicum  frozen spinach  350gm white rice  chicken stock       Snack         Two scoops whey  shaken over ice  2 slices toast with jam        Dinner          200gm lean protein in an Italian ragu  125gm pasta  70gm lettuce with dressing  I m fairly utilitarian in what I eat during the week  but I m a big fan of food  so I might cook something fancy or go out to dinner on the weekends  The way I see it  I get most of my basic nutrition out of the way with minimal thought  which frees up calories to eat something different or get creative with cooking in the kitchen       Years 8     Training    My overall goal is a 700kg total in competition  I set it way back when I first started when a 700kg total in the 105kg class would qualify you for Worlds in Australia  The totals have gone up now  but that still remains what I want to hit  For me  that number means I ve taken myself from novice to fairly respectable strength athlete  which is why I want it so bad    Someday I ll improve my lagging squat  always my Achilles Heel    However  for now I m sick of powerlifting  so I ve picked up some BJJ to learn a new skill and have fun until the lifting fire starts burning again  Until then  I m enjoying using my strength and weight for a combat sport  even if I still get smashed by most other people in my class           Lessons  In no particular order  here s what I ve learned from lifting over the years        Show up  ask questions  keep going    from Dan John   Getting where you want is simple   just follow these three steps over and over again  Just like anything else  getting good at lifting takes time  patience  and knowledge  and consistency  curiosity  and persistence will get you there  And the time and money you spend educating yourself will pay off significantly later on      Cultivate your passion for training  whatever that means for you    Some people can chug away at the same program for years  I m not one of them  I tend to lose my training mojo if I focus on one goal for too long  I get better consistency from changing up what we re focusing on  When my motivation starts waning  we switch up programming to learn new things and keep it fun  like making push press and front squats a main movement and trying to learn handstands  for example  This keeps the fire burning for when I inevitably feel the urge to get back to powerlifting      Have a support network of people around you    A good coach is invaluable  but you also want a good physical therapist to keep you healthy  heal things  and get you performing better  Having other people to consult in addition to your coach or to push you more helps an enormous amount  I ve got other people I talk to about training like u NRLlifts to help troubleshoot or tell me I m being a wuss      Your program matters way less than how well you execute that program    I used to think the key was finding the optimal program  and that the perfect combination of volume  intensity  and frequency would get me strong  Now  I m figuring out that the most important thing is how well you execute a program  Is your technique good every set  and are you constantly trying to improve it  Do you know what you re trying to achieve with each exercise and change your exercise tempo and execution to do that  Do you make smart training decisions when things feel light or heavy  Do you slowly evolve your program over time to make it work for you  That s what will determine a successful training block      Technical development is number one    This is weirdly controversial  but I do think there are fundamental technical principles  eg staying tight  getting the primary movers lifting the weight  maintaining torso rigidity  for each lift that you should be constantly working on  Unlike  perfect form  which apparently needs you to deload to the bar every so often  excellent technique should allow you to lift the most weight possible  and you should always work to improve yours  Here  an in person coach can really help  You can watch all the YouTube you want  but proprioception  understanding how your body feels moving in space  is critical to technique development      You need to eat more    Especially if you re tall  To look jacked and get strong you ll need to put on a lot of weight and muscle  and to do that you ll need to shovel down food  It took me way more food than I thought to get to 105kg      It s recovery dummy    See above point  Nailing your recovery will get you stronger  The easiest place to get your numbers up is to improve your nutrition  sleep  stress  and alcohol consumption  Magic will happen when you get those in order as you leave more recovery resources for your body to adapt with      You ll get injured  and that s fine    Injuries are inevitable if you re trying to get stronger  but rarely are they life altering  Injury recovery is a skill worth learning in itself  When you re hurt  you should be thinking  how can I heal this as quickly as possible  and what else can I work on in the meantime   If your knee hurts  you can bench  If your elbow hurts  you can front squat  There is always something to improve while you re working on rehab  For more on injury recovery and mindset  read  this brilliant write up  https   jujimufu com blogs training jujimufu on injuries  from Jujimufu      What you do outside the gym matters   Often  we assume that only what we do in the gym impacts our lifts and the way we move  But when you think about it  we only spend 1 2 hours training  which leaves 22 23 hours for us to move and impact ourselves in other ways  If things start going wrong  the first place to look is outside  A real life example  I was prepping for a meet and things were going well  All of a sudden  my squat nosedived  I went from squatting 190 200kg high bar to missing 170kg low bar  My coach and I went through every detail  and it turned out 6 weeks ago I d bought a pair of shoes that was too small  I stopped wearing them  my squat recovered  and I set a 5kg PR in comp  Whatever those shoes did  they made it very hard for me to balance       Lifting will change you in ways you won t expect    I didn t expect lifting to have such a profound impact on me  I was a smart kid who didn t have to try that hard in school  so a hobby like lifting where I couldn t just cruise through was shocking and refreshing  7 years into lifting  I m far more disciplined  hard working  and systematic in how I handle problems  and I m way more confident in myself and my ability to accomplish goals  professionally and personally  And looking kind of jacked is pretty nice as well   If you made it this far  I hope you took something useful from it  Always happy to answer any questions if you got em  Happy training ,,

 Background   Photos   I ve never been into fitness  or any sport for that matter  and I ve been working a sedentary job ever since I turned 18  My hobbies largely involved indoor activities too  such as video or board games    In December 2018  27 y o   I was at my highest weight of 110 0kg   Photos here  https   imgur com a JtAdkdc    By late December 2019  28 y o   I had managed to drop down to around 83 85kg   Photos here  https   imgur com a OhiBblJ    In January 2020  I realized I ve reached a point where I didn t feel I can maintain my diet anymore  I needed some sort of an exercise in my life  I decided to hit the gym with a program designed by myself  for the curious  here s what it looked like   Fuck around Program  https   imgur com 0I3M8dw    I did that program in and between lockdowns in 2020 but by April 2021 I realized it s not really working  so I moved on to 5 3 1    Current physique  April  23  please bear in mind the photos are taken after a gym session  so lightning and pump are probably in my favour    Relaxed   Photos here  https   imgur com a fWTgAtO    Flexed   Photos here  https   imgur com a BOe1Sjl      Training Max Progress  PRs  Program    Graph of my TMs  https   imgur com zJgxCBr    I ve tried to capture the TMs every couple of months  but you ll notice there s a significant gap between March  22 and August  22  The reason for this gap is that I had friends visit me for 10 days mid April  a tattoo appointment mid May and I travelled back home for 10 days end of June start of July  Because of that  I spent significant time out of the gym and each time I went back to it  I d go back to Week 1       Lifts     Squat   In summer  22  I switched from high bar squat to low bar squat   I never quite felt comfortable in my form and I found low bar squat to feel much better for me personally and I immediately saw an increase in my TM     Bench   In early autumn  22  I had to reset my bench TM as I failed to achieve even 3 reps during my TM testing week  Over the next iteration  I made dumbbell bench press one of my Push accessory exercises and I believe that helped me progress it further     Overhead Press   OHP has always been my nemesis lift and I spent basically all of  22 resetting it over and over again  I came to realize I feel a lot of tension in my core area during the lifts  so that  along with Deadlifts  made me finally include core work  In January this year  I somehow finally managed to hit 1 plate  along with extra 2 5kg  during my TM test  Video of that over here   1 plate OHP  https   imgur com P3oh4ye    I believe doing Smith machine OHP  as well as back hyperexentions  helped me tons with increasing the weight on this     Deadlift   No complaints around this one  it has been progressing steadily but it did make me realize how much I rely on my core for the whole movement so it was a big motivator to include core work in my program    Personal Records as of today  based on Week 3 AMRAP set      Lift   Reps x Weight  kg                               OHP   2 x 65     Squat   5 x 127 5     Bench   5 x 97 5     Deadlift   5 x 165        Assistance Work   I ve always aimed to get 100 reps in all assistance work categories  usually 2 exercises with 50 reps each  5x10   Instead of core work  I used to do legs and contrary to what the program recommends  I did bilateral leg work as my time spent in gym was close to  and sometimes depending on how busy the gym was  surpassing the 2 hours mark    For the first year  I didn t stick to specific assistance work for X amount of iterations   I d have  preferred  exercises to do  such as lat pulldows  the pec flys machine and leg extensions   but I d often do something else  especially if there s a queue for the machines racks I need to use  but as time went by  I started sticking to specific exercises for 3 iterations of the program  plus the TM testing week  10 weeks total   My general rule of thumb was to work with weight I can properly do my sets and reps without feeling like I m putting in no effort  Only once I feel comfortable with the weight  I d bump it up a bit and repeat    All my accessory work was focused on the main muscle groups   chest  back  legs   I never did any arms isolating exercises and instead I let those be trained as a supplement group  My general go to are    Push  Dumbbell press  Incline Decline bench  Pec fly  Smith machine OHP    Pull  Lat pulldowns  Seated and Barbell rows    Legs  Press  Extensions  Curls  Bulgarian split squats    Core  ABS roll  Hyperextensions  good ole crunches    I never did deload weeks    between the ongoing tattoo project across my upper body and traveling back home  I d take 7 to 14 days break from the gym after my appointments to let the skin heal properly  After each break  I d revert back to Week 1 of my current iteration  regardless of where I ve had to stop  reason being that I often found myself too weak to jump straight back into Week 3  for example  after such a break      Diet   Supplements   My diet throughout the past two years has been very simple   get the minimum amount of protein to stimulate muscle growth and have as varied and as healthy diet as possible while still allowing myself less than ideal  as well as flat out junk  food  but in moderation  I ve done no bulks or cuts and instead focused on what I believe is called  body recomp   I figured that once I find something I truly enjoy  I d eventually reach sort of an equilibrium between what I eat and how many calories I burn which will result in me maintaining my weight     I started 5 3 1 at 82 8kg  throughout the 2 years my weight has varied from 82kg to 89kg  currently being 86 6kg  I ve done no calories tracking in this period    My day to day diet looks like this    Morning  2 coffees with skimmed milk   Lunch  250g grilled chicken breasts with 410g of baked beans   On workout days  in the afternoon roughly 2 hours before my workout  I d have a pot of skyr  450g  with a banana and honey   Dinner  Chicken Pork Beef Fish with anything high in carbs  mainly boiled rice or baked potatoes alongside some green salad  olives etc  Dinner calories would usually vary based on what I cook  but these are the general ingredients included  My general rule of thumb was to avoid meals   recipes very high in  saturated  fats or salt  and frying anything    Pre bed  Pot of skyr  450g  with a banana and honey   As for supplements  over the years I tried taking creatine  fish oil  magnesium  vitamins and glucosamine but I never built the habit of consistently taking any of them on a daily basis  I stopped buying creatine a long time ago as I d usually just end up throwing it away and most of the vitamins I take only occasionally      Goals   Closing Words   I m hoping that by the end of the year  I ll be able to hit 2 3 4 plates for bench  squat and deadlift  I d also like to move on to more systematized program  likely still within the 5 3 1 framework once I get my hands on the 5 3 1 Forever book  and just keep on building on the foundation I ve got so far    Finally  I cannot thank everyone in this sub who s answered my questions across all the threads  Thank you for being so welcoming and so helpful  When I first walked into the gym  I had no idea what to expect  now I spend almost as much time talking to people as I do lifting weights  y all gym folks are great ,,

12lgk9fpost,12lgk9f,,gzcl,2023-04-14 02:30:56,Four Years Without A Rest Day,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/12lgk9f/,248.0,120.0,The goal of this post is to provide a brief description of my training  the things I ve accomplished  and a few tips to help make it easier for you to also begin training daily    Throughout this post I will be linking to other resources of mine that will provide more depth and detail to my training  including specific programs  workouts  lifts  etc  Follow those links to get more out of this post than what is summarized here    With what is provided in this post I am confident that you can train yourself effectively for the rest of your life      TLDR    I have not taken a rest day for over four years  This means I have worked out every day for over 1 460 consecutive days  as of this writing it is closer to 1 500 days   Nearly all my workouts have been with weights  an overwhelming majority being barbells     I got bigger  stronger  and fitter in general      Why Do I Workout Daily      The short answer is that it benefits me greatly    Here is the long answer  blog    Physicality  Creativity  and Consciousness   https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2023 04 physicality creativity and consciousness html     Why Should You Workout Daily     Because daily exercise is fundamental to living a healthy life  It may also  benefit you mentally  https   www ihrsa org improve your club new report exercise plays key role in mental health well being   and spiritually  not just physically  read the above linked blog post to understand my philosophy of all this     I have had many  many people contact me about training daily and provide feedback about how their lives have improved  The outpouring of encouragement and mutual commitment to daily training has been inspiring  Therefore  I have reason to believe that you could see similar benefits      Training Structure and Results  Summary Achievements      I use my  General Gainz  https   www reddit com r gzcl comments aqkdgo happy gday gainerz   training framework to structure my workouts and progression    Currently I am focused on getting an all time 1RM PR for  squat and bench  https   www instagram com p Cq8D8Ecgxgj    I am within 85  of those numbers at this time  despite not training specifically for powerlifting as I did in the past  For context  I do a lot more conditioning work now compared to my best powerlifting days    For several periods during these four years I would train the same lift every day  Like the  squat  https   www instagram com p B5nlw7pgZ04  img index 1   which helped me accomplish a 20 rep max PR  As well as the  press  https   www instagram com p B5i4OGAAyl   img index 1   which helped me get a 1RM PR    In about an eight hour period I hiked four 14 000 foot mountains then went to my gym and completed a powerlifting total of 1 240 pounds    video  https   www instagram com p CiaTQzxAOcr      Other periods of time I did a  body part split  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022 01 general gainz body building html   This helped me grow my arms to nearly 18 inches while weighing less than 200 pounds    During other periods of time I focused on conditioning  which allowed me to squat a tremendous number of reps   225x51  https   www youtube com watch v LxlK7QEI2dw  and  135x5x44  https   www youtube com watch v 05U 51I92pk    Both of those were very recent    On the anniversary of four years  I aimed to hit a 1 460 pound total doing lifts that I never  or rarely  have ever trained  These were the Zercher squat  315 lbs    Reverse Grip Bench  265 lbs    Jefferson Deadlift  565 lbs    Behind the Neck Press  185 lbs    and Strict EZ Bar Curl  130 lbs    For further context  on the day of these lifts I weighed about 190 pounds and was deep into conditioning focused training  not peak strength  nor was I training for these lifts at this time  I was simply strong enough to move this weight despite not training heavy    video  https   www instagram com p CpyXVv1gLaX        How to Train Daily        Tip  1  Focus on recovery    Eat  hydrate  sleep  and destress as much as you can  or need to   Though I was not perfect in every aspect  I was consistently doing well in all of these  At times I do have poor nights of sleep  however  this has been less so since I started training daily  My diet wasn t perfect  some days I was super busy and barely ate  other days I overate    On average I ate well and got about  75 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight and remained well hydrated daily  I didn t let an imperfect day of eating ruin the greater goal  to keep training daily    Lastly  find time for you to pray or meditate  or read  or go for a nice casual hike   do something that alleviates stress  something that isn t considered  training        Tip  2  Develop work capacity    This is the foundation of recovery  If you have little work capacity  then you will quickly overreach  By having a high work capacity you can still train a lot  and have challenging workouts  yet it will take a whole lot more to push you into recovery debt  Think of it like this  if you can do more in your usual training  then your  deload  workouts will look like the average gym goer s limit  Not only that  but even a slight reduction in load or volume will benefit you that much more  This is because your body develops the ability to recover as you develop work capacity  so when you decide to go a bit easier  the recovery time is faster due to the reduced load  volume  and or density in your training    How to develop work capacity  gradually add more work  Do another exercise at the end of your workouts  or add another set  or more reps to your sets  You could do a workout that has higher reps than your usual  You could begin tracking your rest and work towards less rest  thereby increasing your training density  You could do  mini workouts  where you quickly complete several sets of bodyweight exercises HIIT style  Sled push  drag  carry weight  do sprints  walk more  swim  hike  get your heart rate up  keep it there for longer than you usually do  and do it more often    More insight on developing work capacity   The Process is the Goal   https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022 10 1300 days process is goal html     Tip  3  Use a flexible schedule    Had I strict days on which to do specific lifts  loads  and volumes  then I would have failed and given up years ago  Because I remained flexible in my training  both in structure and progression  I was able to train daily and continue inching towards ever more challenging goals  Perhaps my legs were not recovered from a tough squat workout  No problem  I would do a lighter day instead and focus on volume  rep speed  pauses  or some other quality  Likewise  if my arms were still feeling weak after a hard day of benching  then I would do lighter arm exercises  which aided in their recovery    Though I haven t had a pre planned dedicated deload week in these four years  I have intentionally taken  easier days  on account of lack of sleep  being ill  having migraines  I have chronic rhinitis and sinusitis   An easier day might be just doing arms and getting a great pump  Or instead of going for heavy squats I would do lighter ones and focus on speed  both bar speed  but also shortening my rest and getting the workout done quickly     Here s a helpful planner made by  u benjaminbk    Burrito But Big  A  General Gainz  based 12 Week Planner  https   www reddit com r gzcl comments 12ggfn7 burrito but big a general gainzbased 12week    Another insightful read by the same author   365 Days and Counting  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2021 12 365 days and counting html   Includes great tips on how to develop work capacity      Tip  4  Realize that you must train tomorrow    This has been tremendously helpful for me because it helps regulate my workout  today   When I was taking rest days I would all too often go hard  way too hard  because  tomorrow I get to sit around and recover   I had a false understanding of recovery back then  Because of that I would grind myself into the ground at the gym and not recover all weekend  then hit Monday again  hard  and over several weeks push myself deeper into recovery debt    Now  because I train daily  I am better at regulating my efforts in the gym  I am much more accurate when it comes to estimating my effort and determining when to go for more weight  or for more reps  and when to back off of one or both  Because I ll be training tomorrow  and ultimately that s the priority  daily consistency   then I will govern what I do today accordingly  This requires flexibility and having a good understanding of how to progress  which is why I so dearly love my General Gainz training framework       Tip  5  Start small  Start NOW    Do not wait for the perfect plan  Do not wait to have all information you feel might be necessary to have the OpTiMaL PrOgRaM  Do not wait until you move to that fancy new gym with all the best machines  Do not wait until your schedule is more relaxed  Action produces results  results build momentum  momentum produces further action    It is easy to start training daily  Begin small  Really small  It can be as little as a set of push ups for those who are new to training  Let where you are dictate how you start training daily  If you re deep into powerlifting or bodybuilding  start including more cardio  go for a quarter mile jog  then on your next former rest day  go for a block longer  or try doing the same distance a little faster  You get the idea   If you re more of a cardio enthusiast than a lifter  then do a circuit of bodyweight exercises instead of your next rest day  or  wild idea  just run every day    The easiest way to exercise daily is to simply  do what you like every day   Don t let a schedule  a program  equipment  or anything else stop you  Short of an emergency  you have time  If you don t   then you need to examine your priorities  which this post cannot do for you         What to do when sick     On days when I wasn t feeling well  I still trained  but went easy  And because I have a great work capacity  these training days didn t make me sicker  In fact  I ve only been ill twice  and then only for a few days  I recover rapidly from workouts  and I surmise that the same is true for when I get exposed to illnesses    The most common illness I got was migraines during this period  On these days I would train arms  No doubt this contributed to the arm growth I achieved      Conclusion    I hope this post communicated why you should and how you can train daily  Doing so has helped me more than I could have imagined when I started  nearly 1 500 days ago  Though I have been lifting for nearly 15 years  I consider these four to be the most fulfilling and achievement filled   This is not about discipline  but passion   https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022 01 1000 days html    Because of my experience  and the experience of those I ve trained and talked with  who also trained train without rest days  I am confident that you too will see similar benefits    Lastly  no  I am not using performance enhancing drugs or medically prescribed hormone therapy ,,

Start  249lbs    End  251 1lbs    x200B     Goals    My goal at 50 years old was to hit 315    and I got it   once  I really wanted to get myself past the  probably self imposed mental  plateau of a single rep at 315  and into the realm where I wasn t as     apprehensive      about being under the bar with heavy weight  and be able to sustain it with high frequency         The first thing I ll say about this program is that it will teach you humility very  very quickly if you don t RTFM  Specifically  the author states   When you start out a program like this  you need to be conservative  I had to hit 4 reps at 85  of my 1rm every day  and follow that up with a ton of volume    If you go into this program and overestimate from the start  you re going to have a very rough time   like   the 2nd week  To that end  I dropped my 1RM numbers by 20lbs right at the onset  as I could see  using my spreadsheet  some of the numbers later on in the program  Excel for the win  there       Starting Lifts    all weight in lbs       Focus Lift   Starting 1RM     Bench Press  300      Deadlift  185  back injury      Squat  115  back injury           Assistance Lifts   Starting 1RM

superset 10x neutral  overhand  supine   35     EZ Bar Curl  65     Tricep Pushdowns  65  I must say  my Kabuki Kadillac bar was a complete shoulder saver   I highly doubt at my age that my shoulders could have taken the abuse that this program dishes out  So  recommendation is that if you re old er   neutral grip can be your best friend  but still have aleve on hand    I didn t forget about standard grip  My slingshot  which I bought specifically for this program and was getting used to during the 7 weeks  was done with standard grip  and I know that I ll have to compete with regular grip  but I felt that give the frequency of training  I would rather avoid potential injury  50 days   no hurty  Success   Most days I kept my start time right about 2 30pm  and was in and out of my garage in 60 90 minutes  Some days were obviously much much shorter than that  and a couple  looking at you  14 set day in week 2  that went longer  but that was my average  I think that younger folks who require less rest time could also cut that time down dramatically  I don t think I d recommend this program on a cut   it seems to be built for those who are in a bulk  or possibly  like me  a recomp  ok  fair enough  beer belly isn t really a recomp  but I did lose a couple of pants sizes   I didn t have any recovery issues   got plenty of sleep  took my creatine and drank plenty of water  and got  mostly  enough protein  One thing I should have done better is cut back on the alcohol   there were a couple of days that weren t pretty because of that   Speaking of not pretty   there will be days when you just fail    bad  Like  can t lift the bar after a set bad  As the author says    It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave    There are quite a couple  0  reps in my spreadsheet  but luckily I bounced back from nearly all of them  There are also a couple of days that were  in my opinion  just unrealistic to hit  An example was Week 1  Day 6   having to hit 102  of your estimated 1RM  and the same for Week 7  Day 48   I chose to put a little less weight on the bar  ok  a lot less weight  rather than potentially risk injury  This may just be   my   fault based upon how I interpreted the author s initial post and converted it to my spreadsheet  but I m pretty sure I got the calculations right  so   maybe that was just the intent  to   really   put the lifter out of his her comfort zone   At the end of the 50 days  though  I think the results speak for themselves here  I completely smashed any and all expectations that I had going in  I quite honestly never expected to do 320 for 5 reps in just 7 weeks  or put 345 up for 1  I m also very glad that my back is feeling better  but squats still suck ass      Results     all weight in lbs       Bench Press    Start 1RM  315 End  Est  1RM  373 86   58 9 lbs or 18 69      Deadlift   Start 1RM  185 End  Est  1RM  401 37   216 4 lbs or 116 96      Squat    Start 1RM  115 End  Est  1RM  286 13

been",https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/13ibvjv/,229.0,120.0,  INTRO    If you re not a fan of Jamie Lewis  originally of  Chaos and Pain  and now  Plague of Strength   you re not going to enjoy this piece  but I m going to lead by saying Jamie has flat out changed my life all for the positive and I owe him a TON  and the least I can do is sing his praise  positively review his material and try to get others to buy from and support him   So that s what I m going to do here    Get the program here  https   plagueofstrength com the feast famine and ferocity diet is now updated and available as an e book   I m going to write this backwards  starting with the results  going into the program reviews  then the background   I figure that s really what s important          STARTING WITH RESULTS      It s so rare I do photos   so appreciate this  https   i imgur com uwkBgoj png    This isn t 6 weeks purely on FFF  but the end of Super Squats and the final week of  Feast   so about 9 weeks of change         As far as lift results go  I genuinely hate detailing this stuff  since my training is so wild and difficult to track   I m gonna just shutgun some stuff here  but ultimately  I m the strongest I ve been in a LONG time while also the leanest      From week 1 to week 4 of Feast  I went from only being able to do 3 rounds of EMOM 200lb log clean and press for doubles to getting through a full 8 rounds of it      From 4 triples of SSB squats w 405 in the first week of Famine to 6 triples of 415 in the third week of Feast     4x2x321 axle bench in the first week of Famine  10x2x301 in week 3 of Feast  with 1 minute rests vs 2      But honestly  stuff like  this   https   www youtube com watch v QbtDWEWJ8wA  is really what I find most impressive as far as results   That s an 11 4 3x405 chain mat pull  but the context is  I had been walking around the zoo for 6 hours that day  having only had a Metabolic Drive shake for lunch and then coming home from a solid  carnivore feast  https   global discourse cdn com tnation original 4X e 1 d e1d5ffdf73834fc67487531f81d2d921476cc598 jpeg   and I had 5 minutes before we were going to turn right around and walk the dog  get in my 2 miles    I threw on some shorts I had on the laundry  warmed up with ONE rep of 155 chains  and then pulled that   All the daily activity  new stuff I ve been exposed to  good eating  etc etc has me fully healed and ready to move and act when needed   I ve genuinely just never felt more capable and dangerous     PROGRAM REVIEW     THE PROGRAMS IN GENERAL     I m drawn to Jamie s programming primarily because he doesn t rely much on percentages and he encourages experimentation   His programming is far more ideas and structures than an actual set routine  and the focus is on effort   What was even more awesome about both Feast and Famine was that Jamie offers a 3 4 day variant and a 5 6 day variant of both programs  so there s a LOT of flexibility there   Those 3 4 day variants are LOADED to make it all work out  so  amazingly  I found myself drawn to the 5 6 day variants instead   Since I get up early to train  I m able to train 5 days a week without issue and didn t need to cut down to 3 4 days  despite the fact I ve written about the value of lifting weights 3 4 days a week to put on size   It helps that  at this point in my training  putting on size wasn t the concern  I had Super Squats for that   For now  the goal was simply to experience the training and see what happened     AWESOME ELEMENTS OF FAMINE AND FEAST PROGRAMS       Both programs feature a day Jamie refers to as  Dealer s Choice   which is as it sounds  do what you want   For Famine  it s up to 90 minutes   For Feast  there s no set time and Jamie even permits you to make it a day off if needed  which  despite all the increased cals  you may still need  I ll detail that more later    Either way is brilliant  and I think EVERY program needs this   Trainees are stupid   I m including myself in there   Trainees will ALWAYS sneak stupid crap into a program   Pet lifts  curls  of course   stupid human tricks and gimmicks   weak areas   etc    Trainees will inevitably wreck a program because they ll change it up too much to fit in all this extra stuff that they end up reducing the effectiveness or flat our violating the intent  turning accumulation into intensification or GPP   By having ONE day of the program where you just do what you want  you can get it all out of your system and then get back on program   It s the  cheat meal  of training   During Famine  I d throw in ALL that extra stuff I was doing before  Poundstone curls  lateral raise deathsets  belt squats  Kroc Rows  mat pull ROM progression  etc   During Feast  my schedule was nuttier  so I often would just continue the ROM progression cycle and  if I had time  throw in some conditioning work and call it good   But in both cases  my program compliance was MUCH stronger compared to programs I d run in the past     Daily physical requirements daily work   Prior to starting up the program  I had my own daily work  which was  50 chins  50 dips  50 pull aparts  40 reverse hypers  30 GHRs  20 standing ab wheels  and often some neck work   I d get this done no matter what   Jamie prescribes a daily 2 mile walk  outside  no matter what  along with 300 squats and 300 push ups   I balked when I first saw that and  in turn  loved that I had a new challenge in front of me   And yeah  the first 2 days  I was SORE AS HELL  but upon adapting  I saw some AMAZING results   The push ups and squats have honestly been transformative  as I m seeing veins all over my quads and shoulders  but honestly  that daily 2 mile walk outside has probably been one of the most positive things I ve ever done for myself   It s a chance to clear my head  get in some vitamin D  and bring back some health into my life   Having it be a daily requirement and forcing myself to come up with ways to fit the walk into my day has been awesome  and my dog is appreciating all the time outside as well  and it s gotten me to break out my weight vest again to add in even more resistance opportunities   And that 2 mile walk has become a mere minimum  as I find myself becoming  activity seeking   and will often get in 2 miles unweighted walking and then an extra 1 2 miles with a weight vest on as well      On the daily work  Jamie is adamant that  this is not part of your workout it is part of being a human being    I appreciate the sentiment there   Being able to move your body through space is huge   That said  I was big on making the push ups and squats INTO a workout when possible   Toward the end  my go to was to use Tabata intervals of 20 seconds on 10 seconds off and do squats during the 20 second and push ups during the 10   I d settle on 20 squats per round and 15 push ups  getting me 300 squats in 15 rounds  and then I d do the remaining push ups as fast as possible   Keeping to those Tabata intervals makes this a pretty solid conditioning hit and only takes about 9 minutes to knock out   Typically  I d do this after the workout on weekdays  and on weekends I took to accomplishing it literally as soon as my feet would hit the floor in the morning   I HATE working out  still do  and getting this done ASAP was pretty big for me   Sometimes  though  I d get cute and start incorporating push ups and squats into a larger conditioning paradigm  like in a circuit with swings  or GHRs  or chins  etc   But  either way  I always met these goals     DEVIATIONS I MADE TO BOTH PROGRAMS      Jamie encourages experimentation  so game on     Jamie slots that  Dealer s choice  toward the middle of the week with both programs  but for my work schedule it worked better to put it on Fridays Weekends   In the case of Famine  his middle of the week workout is either a day off or a 30 minute bodyweight conditioning circuit  which fit MUCH better with my weekend schedule  so putting that on Sat Sun and Dealer s choice on Friday allowed me to get in a 60  minute dealer s choice workout  which got in a lot of work   In the case of Feast  there are 5 loaded days of training that worked much better for M F for me  and then dealer s choice on weekends allowed me to get anywhere from a 4 60 minute workout  depending on what my choice was as the dealer       I made sure to run a full week of both programs exactly as written out  to include rest times  exercise order  etc   In doing so  many of my workouts ran into the 80  minute mark  which became a bit cumbersome with my schedule  but I wanted to understand how the training  felt  before I mucked with it   Once I had that baseline established  I broke out the giant sets  short rest times  etc  all those tricks I ve used in the past to get in more volume in less time   I still made sure to bring the intensity  but wherever I could find logical pairings and groupings  I d throw them in   The 5xAMRAP hanging leg raises that happen EVERY training day are a quick kill  and much of the arm work could work in with other stuff   Sometimes  though  it d become something incredibly brutal  like bouncing between heavy shrugs and squats during Feast  more on that later      You ll note I did NOT write about additional conditioning work  extra workouts  etc etc   Jamie really  fixed  my compulsion here   I d be done with the training and I d trained  enough    This was really pretty huge for me     FAMINE  SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS DEVIATIONS     With Jamie s permission  I took full workout footage of all my training sessions of Famine AND Feast  so I ll post those if you want to see the whole thing in action      Famine  https   www youtube com watch v 5VnicWt6NqU list PLfcuGAffLlSdfWeHmA6BsUctSrdGdaObB pp iAQB      Feast  Playlist isn t fully updated  but the videos are all on my channel  https   www youtube com watch v 5k8jkk6VLec list PLfcuGAffLlSf y7VAbGZ3TVKoE1T5OycC pp iAQB     I made a few deviations from the programming  more out of equipment limitations   I don t have a leg extension or leg curl machine   For extensions  I could use my reverse hyper  sit on top of it  hook my feet through the straps and do extensions   That worked well   Turning around to do curls that way   Not as great    I stuck with it through Famine  since it s only 2 weeks  before eventually just going with GHRs during Feast  and when I return to Famine  that s where I ll go     My cable set up is pretty janky  so for cable rows I went with landmine t bar rows instead   I also don t have a machine shoulder press  but I rigged up a VERY awesome Viking press set up with bands that was clutch  you ll see it on the video      Strongman implements regularly featured  because they re awesome   I also was making extensive use of the SSB  because I was still pretty broken from Super Squats     I didn t follow the diet 100   but I met the spirit of it   LOTS of caffeine  shakes made up the majority of my nutrition  calories were low   I trained fasted as well       FEAST  SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS DEVIATIONS     I underwent a MAJOR nutritional pivot during Feast  and it s been one of the most positive things I ve done for myself in a long time   I absolutely didn t meet Jamie s prescription as far as calories goes  primarily because I m not going to count calories   In addition  the shakes were still regular features because they went a long way toward streamlining my life   HOWEVER  for my solid meals  I went carnivore   I d been wanting to try out a carnivore diet for a few years now  after listening first to Shawn Baker and then Paul Saladino and a few other carnivore influencers talk to the approach  and constantly hearing Mark Bell beat the drum for it    This also matches up a bit more directly with how Jamie laid out the  Apex Predator Diet   as the solid meals were all meat   I honestly just wasn t in a good place psychologically to undertake it  but this protocol was VERY freeing in that regard  so I went full steam ahead and it s been amazing   I ll probably just have to make it another blog post  a continuation of the overhaul series   but I m only eating meat  eggs and cheese dairy  and I attribute that to some of the AMAZING results I ve gotten  will sum that up at the end    I still opt for high quality sources  grassfed beef dairy when possible  pasture raise eggs  etc   and I m still using supplements to fill in gaps  Superfood  Flameout  several others   but the Feast has been a carnivore Feast   Conan approved       After the first week of Anderson squats  I used a larger ROM and started using bands   That was the right call   My hip and knee were STILL messed up from Super Squats  and heavy loading was killing them   The bands allowed me to keep the bar weight low  but the intensity was THROUGH THE ROOF   Try breaking a dead weight off of chains when it s banded in place   It takes EFFORT   And you can NOT quit once you start      Rather than do 5x10 15 leg curls  I did GHRs   But along with that  I did them with my push ups and squats  turning it into a circuit workout   I worked up to a final workout of 15 rounds of 15 GHRs  20 squats  15 push ups  then got in the remaining 75 push ups to get my 300  then went for a max set of GHRs   It was a LOT of GHRs      For benching  week 1 was dead bench  week 2 was dead bench against bands  week 3 was touch and go axle bench  week 4 was pause axle bench with chains   I ultimately just needed gimmicks to get me through it  but I was getting stronger     For pressing  I set out with a goal to get all 8 sets done in 8 minutes  using an EMOM style  so I never increased the weight on it   Different ways to progress     For the squats and shrugs day  I rotated between SSB front squats and SSB squats  primarily because  with a deathset at the end  it was good to use the SSB   SSB front squats are honestly a hidden gem of a movement that I rediscovered  and I ll need to include it more in the future   For the shrugs  I did my best to set it up like a hip and thigh lift  but on one set in particularly I REALLY crunched my left quad and had to eventually settle on trap bar shrugs for the final week   And I think that s going to be a more permanent solution   It just works better     On that same day  instead of the leg curl work  I would do GHRs while holding a kettlebell in a goblet squat position   Honestly  this is an AMAZING hamstring workout   I made my final one particularly tough by doing sets of 3 every 20 seconds  getting in 9 sets total  then the 2 AMRAPS  then dying     For pulls  I did a whole bunch of crazy crap  but it always included the trap bar   High handle one week  ox lift one week  torqued my knee and wanted to keep loading light on the knee   high handle again but with short rests  low handle   I stuck with trap bar because my  Dealer s Choice  was deadlift bar ROM pull progression  I started the cycle on Famine and continued it through Feast  which was like a billion IQ move on my part  and I didn t need to pull heavy with a strap bar twice in a week   This also made the rows awesome  as I went with trap bar rows  which are what I ll bring into Famine   They re an awesome movement    CARNIVORE FEASTS AND RAMPAGE MEALS     This is  of course  the fun stuff

minutes   https   www youtube com watch v cC1mlgTuxZY     I apologize if this seems gratitious  but I just cannot emphasize enough how freeing and ridiculous it is to be able to just eat and eat and eat and see nothing but results   The protocol is self perpetuating  as you see yourself transform  you just keep leaning into it      BACKGROUND     Ancient History Stuff     I am 37 years old  5 9  182 3lbs as of my writing this  have been lifting weights since I was 14  competed in powerlifting and strongman since 2010  have a background in martial arts wrestling  have pulled 601  squatted 502 and benched 342 in a meet  lifted more in the gym  and done lots of nutty things in my time    More Relevant Background      Prior to starting up Jamie s diet and program  I had just finished up Super Squats  also a great program for different reasons   This was an epic run of it  culminating in me squatting 405 for 20 reps and getting fairly jacked and also just absolutely destroying my body in the process   If you re curious about my experience contracting RSV and tearing my tricep in the first run and all the elbow knee hip pain I had in the second run  here are my two write ups  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments znfw1m program review super squats the what would bruce   https   www reddit com r weightroom comments 11go5su program review super squats 3 the revenge     Clearly  a change was needed     I fell back to my old standby of reading  5 3 1 Forever  and ran the 5 3 1 Krypteia base phase  using front squats and SSB squats liberally as a means to heal my elbow  but there was more that needed doing     CHANGE 1  THE APEX PREDATOR DIET      Folks  this write up is HUGE  so I m gonna cliff notes this part  but I intend to post the fully fleshed out review in my blog over the next few weeks  so if you DO want the nitty gritty  feel free to head over there   A lot of this can be found in the  complete overhaul  write ups     I d read about the Apex Predator Diet before  in Jamie s  Issuance of Insanity   Previously  I had written them both off due to the extensive use of protein shakes  but when I considered how much I was spending on solid foods at this point to support myself  I realized a shake based diet would honestly be pretty economical     I abided by Jamie s recommendation for lean trainees to have 2 lunch time solid meals a week  since I got to meet my wife on those days for lunch  and my weekends were more solid food based  since that was time I got to spend with my family and I wasn t going to be drinking shakes while we were out having meals together   I still needed that social healing   But  effectively  any time I could have a shake instead of a meal  I went with a shake     OUTCOME OF CHANGE  1       I ve written about this in my blog already as part of my  complete overhaul  series  but to summarize  this change in and of itself was life changing   I got back SO much of my life and my time with my family by switching the majority of my meals to shakes   The two biggest offenders were my breakfasts and my pre bed meals  of which I ve logged about before  but they were massive and time consuming   Ultimately  I needed  permission  to stop eating like that  and having the recommendation of someone like Jamie went a long way   And after jumping straight in  I found out that I could still train just as hard and be just as strong even without the insane morning and nightly rituals       As this change only lasted the course of the Krypteia base phase and deload  it was only 4 weeks of living this way   After Super Squats  I still had some fluff to lose  and 4 weeks of dieting really isn t much in the grand scheme of things  so I was seeing SOME positive physique changes but nothing significant and then I started following one of Jamie s programs and things REALLY got interesting     CHANGE 2   FEAST  FAMINE AND FEROCITY       It was practically kismet when Jamie released the Feast  Famine and Ferocity e book  itself a re packaging and update of an article series he s previously released on his website   I ll do a review of the book package itself sometime in the future  but a quick summary is it s a 50 page e book where half of it is dedicated to the aforementioned program series of  Famine  and  Feast  while the other half is a republishing of his Bruce Randall article   The later article IS a fantastic read  and I d read it many times beforehand  but it s worth appreciating that it s really more a 30 page e book in this regard   That said  much like I wrote about in my review of Ben Pollack s  Think Big   a short e book where every page is gold is SO much more valuable than 300 pages of fluff  and Jamie s book definitely achieves that standard     I genuinely had no intention of changing programs when I bought the book  I just am such a fan of Jamie that when he sells stuff I buy it so I can give him support   However  upon reading it  I new my fate was sealed  similarly to the first time I read  Super Squats  and was all keyed up to begin my 6 weeks on that program once the book was done   The primary draw was the fact that the  Famine  diet was VERY similar to the Apex Predator modification I was currently following   The primary difference is that Famine has NO solid meals whatsoever  all shakes   I wasn t about to do THAT  but I did permit myself a few  all shakes  days in the 2 weeks that I followed the program  primarily because my schedule would permit for that which meant  specifically  my wife would be out of town and I wouldn t be missing any meals with her   If she s around  I m not going to skip a meal with her to have a shake   Sorry  priorities     I ll then go on to say that  when I finished the entire book  I thought  Yeah  Famine fits  but this diet has been going so well that I m not gonna do  Feast    I ll do Famine and then something else      Yeah  that fell quickly to the wayside   Jamie s programming was so solid that I couldn t wait to see it all the way through   So with that  allow me to discuss both programs in a broad scale before going on to discuss each in detail            CONCLUSION       Folks  I could legit talk about this protocol any Jamie s intervention into my life for a LONG time   It s honestly hard to cut myself off here  my current write up is 10 pages in length  but I m trying to chop it down to make it readable for you    Please ask questions  but  in general  this has become my favorite protocol in 23 years of training   Everyone needs to run it   Everyone needs to try Apex Predator   Everyone needs to buy stuff from Jamie   Call me a shill  I don t care   This has been life changing ,,

14ctakjpost,14ctakj,,CouncilOfStrongs,2023-06-18 19:49:16,The Future of r/Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/14ctakj/,1254.0,0.0,Howdy   You may have noticed that r Fitness was closed for a bit  For the moment  it is back open but restricted   Initially  we closed as part of a recent large protest across Reddit that you may or may not have heard of  with the goal of pressuring Reddit into reworking the upcoming changes to its API  There have been approximately seven thousand news articles and posts about this  so we re not going to rehash all of it here because   let s be real   you probably don t care very much  But we do feel an explanation is owed for where we were at with it  hence this post   While it s unfortunate that taking the sub private can negatively impact those seeking help from community  we felt it was ultimately fine because unlike most subreddits  we have a Wiki   which  realistically  answers over 90  of questions people come here with   which is hosted externally  and would be unaffected   Thousands of subreddits participated in this protest  each of them having their own reasons  For our part  we had two   1  Reddit initially stated they would be removing any and all ability to see NSFW content from the API  While this may not seem like a big deal  it really  really is  The API is what every moderation bot and many moderation tools use to interact with Reddit  Removal of NSFW content from visibility by those tools would absolutely cripple mods  ability to quickly identify bad actors to keep them out of their communities  For instance  spammer accounts could flag their user page as NSFW  and hide 100  of their posts and comments from moderation tools  requiring manual evaluation instead  which thanks to our second reason would require an unreasonable amount of time and effort  2  Reddit has historically been extremely bad at creating effective  user friendly  usable moderation tools   especially for moderators on mobile platforms  The mobile site and app are not built for moderation at all  with some uses cases and features being flat out unusable  For this reason  a significant portion of our mod team has relied on the third party app Apollo to be able to moderate  Apollo has become the most prominent victim of Reddit s punitive API pricing  and very soon it will be gone forever   Late in the week it became clear that Reddit was not going to budge  and the full removal of NSFW content from the API was walked back for accounts that are moderators  We had no reason left to participate in the protest except  Fuck you   which is a good enough reason for some mod teams  but not for ours  especially since that  fuck you  would unfairly extend to our users  Facing this  we decided to continue to keep it private for only a few more days to give us time and space to figure out how we were going to move forward once the moderation tools we rely on disappear  We have mods across several time zones and continents  so coordinating our discussions about this can take time   While we have a tentative plan  it s going to take some time to realize  and since we no longer have any defensible reasons to do so  it s not reasonable to continue to keep r Fitness totally closed off in the meantime  We feel a good middle ground that balances giving people access to the fitness information they want without letting everything go off the rails because of the loss of tools is to reopen the sub in restricted mode  When we have a solution in place that allows us to continue moderating effectively  we will go back to how things were before the protesting started         Some of you are reading this and thinking    Why should I care about you jannies getting your janny panties in a twist because Reddit makes it harder for you to janny my free speech for free and janny janny janny lol they do it for free     The answer to that question is one you can choose to believe  or not  but laughing at salty contrarians aside we re sincere here   All of us on the mod team choose to be mods of r Fitness  and occasionally other fitness subs too  because fitness and helping people with it is something we re passionate about  Most of us have been around internet fitness spaces long enough to remember the insane Wild West it was only 10 years ago  and even worse as you go back further  Most of us remember what it was like to struggle to find legitimate trustworthy answers  or have nowhere to look at all  And for all of us  what we do here is about helping the community have a better experience and get better information than we did when we first started pursuing our fitness goals   The internet is full of spammers  and the fitness space is full of salesmen  phonies  and bullshit  The most consistent thing we ve seen over the years from people who come here is that they feel r Fitness offers something of a barrier to all that  and that barrier comes from active   sometimes aggressive   moderation  by way of removals and bans  This is by far the majority of the actions we take as mods  and it s also the most invisible because when it s done right nobody ever smells the poop before it gets flushed down the toilet   That is why it matters when Reddit makes it harder for us to keep moderating  and that is how it can impact you  who just want to find what you need to achieve your fitness goals and don t care about third party apps or APIs   It becomes harder to maintain the barrier that keeps most of the shitheads away from you  If having that barrier is something you appreciate  then hopefully you can understand why we participated in the protest by taking the sub dark briefly  It was not for us  it was for you  which is why we ve reopened now   There s no more possibility of staying closed being valuable ,,

1953k9lpost,1953k9l,,gzcl,2024-01-12 19:32:23,"The Tom Platz Experience: Pain, pleasure, and high rep squats",https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/1953k9l/,223.0,60.0,Tom Platz is a retired American professional bodybuilder who was active during the 1970s and 1980s  Platz is renowned for his  impressive leg development  https   broscience com wp content uploads 2022 03 tom platz leg png  and is often considered to have the best legs in the history of bodybuilding  Platz s intense training style  often consisting of insanely high rep squats  produced remarkable leg development in an era where many competitors prioritized leg training far less  His legs are iconic  establishing Platz as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time   To improve my legs  the squat itself  and most importantly   to see if I could   I figured why not adopt the Platz approach of high rep squatting  It started off by creating  a list of squat sets  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments zq1bkz comment j0z0wvs  context 3  that  once completed  would result in personal records from a 1RM to a 100RM  Some of these sets were records by many reps  others by just a few  and in the case of the 1RM  less than two pounds   Completing this list of squats was my second priority  next to training daily  which I managed to continue doing  The last squat set from the list that I completed was 185x75  completed in my 1 729th consecutive workout without a rest day   Each of these sets is a lifetime personal record    135x102  https   www youtube com watch v oQcDLXm dm8   Wanted 100    185x76

not completed in order from lightest to heaviest  Rather  I strategized my progression to work my way through the lighter weight  higher rep sets while also pursuing the heavier weight  lower rep sets  The first set completed was on December 23rd  2022  as that is my birthday and 225x50 was the closest to my loosely practiced tradition of doing birthday squats  bodyweight x age   I weighed under 200 pounds at that time and then turned 37 years old   I had 500x2 in mind when first discussing this list  That was later updated to a 3RM because I realized that I had once before squatted 500x2  Also  when discussing the list I did not mention going after a 1RM personal record  as I felt it would be best to keep that one to myself  perhaps because of superstition   Now knowing the results  and before I get into the how  the why should be explained     Why do high rep squats     The grueling nature of high rep squatting is a forge of sorts  Surviving it is something worth writing about  evidenced by the many questions people have asked me in the last year  The most common question is why   There is no scientific reason that makes high rep squats better for size or strength gains  Some  including Platz himself  may object to this  Objections aside  my reason for doing high rep squats was not to merely grow my legs  or to get a stronger squat  though I was sure both would happen  The primary reason I wanted to complete those sets was to see if I could  as each set was daunting  In this way I departed from Tom Platz who used high volume work to excel at his profession of bodybuilding  But for me  the challenge itself was the goal  Did my legs grow  Yes  They are now bigger than ever before  Did my squat get stronger than ever before  Yes  However  each of those things individually could be achieved more easily with a different approach  But it was the approach itself  and the numbers themselves  that motivated me and carried me through the pain of a set to the writhing pleasure of its completion   The thought of doing 225x50 terrified me  As did 275x35  365x15  405x10  and every other set on the list  Perhaps in that way Platz and I now share a thread of kinship  Albeit his weights are far higher than my own  I would like to believe that he also trembled before approaching the squat rack on days where the bar would not be racked until several minutes of squats had passed  Maybe he didn t  Maybe that s why he has the greatest legs in the history of bodybuilding  Maybe he was unafraid  Maybe that s what it takes  Something I don t have   Knowing the pain these sets would inflict generated fear  That fear validated the reason why I should train for and complete these high rep squat sets  There is a connection between being afraid of something and how much you value it  or respect it  or recognize its dominion over you  I grew fearful the moment I thought up the list of squats  Immediately I realized that I must complete them  or at the very least try my best  Otherwise the regret of not trying would hurt more than the sets themselves  and the training for them  which hurt worse than almost anything I ve ever done in the gym  By completing these sets fear would be replaced by joy and I would gain dominion over the squat  The lift that intimidated me most   I would be remiss if I did not mention having watched on several occasions training videos of Tom Platz  simply to see that he did such things  knowing that what one man can do  another can do  So  I tried to be like Tom  and in the process  I managed to become a faint shadow  a mortal emulation  a blurred reflection  a vestige of the Golden Eagle  a demigod of Bodybuilding  Forever will high rep squats be his ghost  that under the bar  and in such pain  can you be emptied of yourself and possessed by Platz     How I trained for high rep squats    Rather than just take a weight and go to failure week in and week out  I followed a more gradual and structured approach  Because of this  my approach was far less aggressive than what Tom Platz would likely promote  That is fine by me  I merely followed a different path to the same goal  squatting a ton of reps  Perhaps my methodology is the fox s way while Platz s the lion s  If so  I hope the shrewd reader finds the following details helpful  The courageous need not read further  for their hearts need nothing else   The reason behind my gradual and structured progression was because remaining injury free was at the top of my list  I managed to do exactly that by limiting my exposure to failure  As a result  I was able to train every day  despite some very hard squat workouts   ensuring that I achieved my primary goal  to train daily  And my secondary goal  to PR my squat from 1RM to 100RM     General and Specific Conditioning     For the last five years I ve been using my  General Gainz  https   www reddit com r gzcl comments aqkdgo happy gday gainerz   training framework  This is a flexible and intuitive approach to structuring and progressing workouts  That said  not every workout while training for these high rep sets followed the intensity and volume limits of my General Gainz model  There were many conditioning focused workouts that were done according to more traditional methods of improving work capacity  for both cardiovascular fitness and the specific fitness needed to complete an obscene number of squats   My conditioning focused workouts were built around Every Minute on the Minute  EMOM   or As Many Rounds  or sets  As Possible  AMRAP   or a certain number of reps and sets completed As Fast As Possible  AFAP   When it comes to conditioning  I had a general component and a specific component  General conditioning is geared towards overall fitness and work capacity  especially aerobic  whereas specific conditioning is aimed at improving the strength and endurance of the legs  particularly the anaerobic pathway  Early in the year I included much more traditional forms of cardio like rowing  stationary biking  and occasionally the treadmill  Later in the year  as my general conditioning had improved enough to get the work done  I shifted my focus towards more specific conditioning workouts that were based on the squat itself   I also included kettlebell swings and step ups as forms of general conditioning work  Those would help prepare me for more challenging specific conditioning sessions where squatting itself was the main course  When doing general conditioning sessions I would pair rowing with something like sit ups  leg lifts  other abdominal exercises  and or pressing of some sort  bench or overhead  as that also served to benefit those lifts as well   An example of these kinds of sessions would be something like a 20 minute AMRAP of 250m row  10 leg lifts  and 10 kettlebell presses  These would typically be done 1x a week  alternating weeks with a specific conditioning session built around the squat   The specific conditioning sessions would be something like a 60 minute EMOM of squatting a weight for 3 reps  for example  These kinds of sessions were not always 60 minutes  That is given as the maximum time I would go for in a specific squat conditioning workout  For such a long duration I would typically only be doing singles  This worked great for developing the strength and stamina for weights from 275 to 365  The reason why I like these kinds of approaches  EMOM  AMRAP  AFAP  to conditioning are that they have different variables and therefore motivating factors   For quick review     EMOM  Every Minute on the Minute     Completing a certain number of reps and exercises each minute  resting in the seconds remaining  Then starting the next set at the next minute  These would often be just a set of squats  but sometimes I would include a set of pull ups as well   These are great for maintaining time while scaling up one or two variables  weight and volume  Most often I would keep one the same while increasing the other  Such as doing a 20 minute AMRAP of squatting 275 for 3 reps followed by 3 pull ups  The next time I completed that workout I would try to put on more weight  doing the same number of reps with squats  or vice versa  same weight but adding a rep   for the sake of moving fast with pull ups I would keep those at bodyweight and just add a rep  Never did I add weight to pull ups  Though for some that is a viable option       AMRAP  As Many Rounds  or Reps  As Possible    This has a fixed time limit  much like the EMOM  however the amount of work completed and the amount of rest is variable  Like with the EMOM example  the variables of weight and volume would increase as the workouts were completed  These conditioning workouts were the toughest because I knew I had to go for a certain amount of time while also limiting the rest as much as possible so that I could complete as much work as possible  The hardest workout I did last year was a 20 minute AMRAP of squats  performing as many sets of 5 reps with 135 pounds as I could   Forty four sets later  https   youtu be 05U 51I92pk si 5Zhgsg4f9R HocPB  I was a squirming heap on the floor in the squat rack  That is likely the hardest workout I ve ever done  I ll never do it again  It was among the most painful experiences of my life  I do not recommend you try it       AFAP  As Fast As Possible     This has a fixed work component  number of exercises  reps  and sets  with the overall time being the variable  Therefore  much like the AMRAP the rest is also variable  These were great because I knew I could reasonably estimate how fast I could get something done  then determine the number of exercises  reps per set  and the number of sets  For a general conditioning session I may do something like 10 rounds of kettlebell swings  push ups  and sit ups  moving as fast as I can through the work  For a specific conditioning session it would be something like 20 sets of 2 reps squats  These were great when I had a busy schedule and a limited amount of time to train  and or I knew I was under recovered and couldn t do too much  but still needing to train  Using this kind of conditioning approach I could limit the volume and intensity  pushing myself by limiting rest  Therefore  these kind of conditioning workouts were great when I needed to get work done while also favoring recovery  considering how much fatigue I had accumulated  and what I needed to do to benefit my conditioning  if even just marginally        Volume Progression    Here s where my General Gainz  GG  training framework came into play  Using GG  one can work through RM progressions by adding weight  intensification  or adding volume to the same weight  accumulation   Because the squat set list consisted of weights I could already lift at the start of 2023  except for 455  500  and 525   I chose a weight for a heavier day and a weight for a separate lighter day  trying to push those for more reps each week  accumulation   A third day of the week often consisted of squatting too  then built around the previously mentioned conditioning workouts   Over the course of the year I was able to push weights I could already lift  gradually earning more reps  in the process building up the ability of squatting those heavier weights I could not yet lift  When I started this set list  I could not squat 455 for one rep  By the time I finished the set list I squatted that weight for five and now live with the pain of regret not going for a sixth     A  very brief  summary of General Gainz    The GG framework progresses your lifts by providing four actions to take that move you through a range of RMs     Find    When you find a new weight at an RM  Like adding 10 pounds to your previous 5RM  You ve found a new weight for an RM you had previously done     Hold    Using the same weight or trying for the same amount of volume  RM  follow up sets   or the same amount of rest between sets  You re holding a variable  weight  volume  rest  consistent from week to week while attempting to progress one or more other variables     Push    Using a known weight and trying to lift it for more reps  Like making your 5RM weight last week a 6RM this week  Likewise  adding reps to the follow up sets that are completed after the RM  For example  doing sets of three reps after the RM if last week you were doing sets of two reps  Rest can also be pushed lower by decreasing the period between sets     Extend    Doing more sets after the RM  All sets after the RM should be at the same weight as the RM  If four sets were completed after the RM last week  extending to five or six sets may be the best option this week  Similarly  rest could be extended by increasing the period between sets   Using those four actions  find  hold  push  extend   I would progress through the First Tier  T1  and Second Tier  T2   by finding an RM at a weight  then trying to push and or extend the follow up volume for the next several weeks  Over the course of several weeks  the follow up volume would accumulate to the point that I could push the RM further  closer to my goal  Once I had achieved the RM goal  I would move on to the next weight   Since the set list has weights that go up in 45 s and 25 s  I only used those weights  I did not use weights between those increments  as I felt that I could push a weight to its target RM  and in the process that prepared me to lift the next weight  At no point in time did I use percentages or small weight increases to prepare me for the next weight on the list  I would lift it  find its initial RM  then over the course of several weeks push that weight to its RM goal     The T1 and T2 structure for GG is as follows     Updated since the inception of GG five years ago      T1    3RM or less  then performing the same weight for singles after the RM  The goal for the follow up set volume is to match the RM via singles  with an extension limit of 3 additional singles beyond the RM  For example  if a 3RM was completed the goal is 3 follow up singles  The maximum would be 6 singles after the 3RM  All the volume is at the same weight     T2    4RM to 10RM  After the RM  perform additional sets of reps at half the volume of the RM  For example  doing 2 rep sets after a 4RM  or sets of 3 reps after a 6RM  or sets of 5 reps after a 10RM  If an odd number RM was completed at a moderate or easy effort  then I would round up  such as doing sets of 5 after an easy 9RM  The minimum goal for follow up volume was 4 sets  thereby doubling the RM value  with an extension limit of 6 sets after the RM   Once the volume limit was reached by extending the singles  T1  or the half sets  T2  to their respective limits I would then try to push the RM higher  There s a bit more nuance and more options to this  which is further detailed in the example progression below  as well as many of my blog posts  Perhaps the most helpful is  General Gainz Body Building  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022 01 general gainz body building html      T1 and T2 Bridge Weights    These are the 4RM  5RM  and 6RM  After these  singles or half sets could be completed  depending on the effort of the RM  For example  doing doubles after a hard 4RM would be quite taxing and therefore limit the total volume possible  Perhaps just two or three sets of two reps  Also  the rep quality would deteriorate faster  Therefore  after a hard bridge weight RM  opt for singles  or in the case of the 5RM and 6RM  you may go for doubles  thereby opening the  effort gap   the difference in reps from the RM to the follow up reps per set  singles after a 6RM have an effort gap of 5 reps  for example  making the singles easier individually  allowing for more high quality volume   Minding the effort gap in these bridge weight RMs helps keep rep quality high  rest low  and in the process allow that weight to cross the bridge from T1 to T2 by adding volume through the push and extend actions   Over the course of many weeks a 3RM becomes a 4RM with singles after  then a 5RM followed by doubles  then a 6RM followed by triples  and eventually a 10RM followed by sets of 5 reps  Such is the essence of how I completed the high rep squat set listed at the start of this post  By adding volume to the follow up work  I built my ability to push the RM  which then promoted still more follow up volume  In so doing I was able to achieve the squat set list  Because I did it  so can you     T3 s    Typically done within a given rep range  from 10 to 12 per set  or 12 to 15  or 15 to 20 for example  Alternatively  these can also be completed for a certain total amount of reps within three to four sets  Such as aiming for 40 total reps in 3 sets  or 60 total reps in 4 sets  Once that rep total was reached  the weight would be increased     Example Workout    The below workout is an example of a lighter session  This session would typically be on Fridays  Monday would have heavier T1  T2  and T3 exercises     Movement  Rep Max  Weight  Effort  Reps Per Follow Up Set  Number of Follow Up Sets    Squat  10RM 315 E   5 reps x 4 to 6 sets  Lat Pull Down  12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets  Leg Press  12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets  Quadriceps Extension  12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets  Hamstring Curl  12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets  GHD Sit Ups  12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets    Example Weekly Schedule    Monday  T1 squat   heavier back and leg accessories  Tuesday  T1 press  or bench    heavy triceps accessories  Wednesday  Conditioning  either general or specific  depending on the week and the block   Thursday  T2 press  or bench    heavy shoulder accessories  Friday  T2 squat   lighter back  ab  and leg accessories  Saturday  T2 press  or bench    lighter shoulder and triceps accessories  Sunday  Biceps  I m trying to get 18  arms and this was the only day I could put sufficient time and energy towards training these directly  It is working      Example Progression    You can find a very detailed example progression in my recent blog    Kill the Bear    https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2023 12 1700 days kill bear html  which provides some insight to the psychological concepts that I used to help me push for more reps  enduring more pain than before  so that I could achieve the squat set list  What pleasure came from completing a set from that list  As soon as it was done  it was as if every muscle fiber in my body rejoiced   The example progression describes an accumulation phase  This is a period in your training where volume progression is the priority  In GG  this is done by extending the follow up sets  which build the capacity need to push the RM   The above linked blog is an example strategy of how to push 365 pounds from a 6RM to a 15RM  about where I started with 365 pounds when I thought up the set list   Doing so more than doubles the volume one is capable of with a weight  This is essentially how I completed every set from the list  I would start with the weight and keep using that weight until I had pushed it to the RM goal  For example  I took 405 from a 5RM to a 10RM  Likewise  I took a 1RM 455 to a 5RM  That built me up for a 1RM 500  which soon became a 3RM 500 and a new lifetime PR   Let my example guide your efforts  I applied these same concepts and similar progression patterns to all the RM goals  The methodical approach detailed in the linked blog is how I achieved every squat set I determined to do last year  Take those concepts and apply them to your weights  abilities  and the movement of your choice  When going for very high rep sets  I widened the range for the RM and its follow up sets while still using the GG ratios  For example  a 25RM followed by set of 12 or 13 reps  the logical extension of the T2 volume range    The blog s example progression  being in the T2  would take place on Fridays  Its progression does not list assistance or accessory exercises  Its purpose is to provide a look at how volume progression works with GG using the main lift  Truthfully  once squatting a 15RM 8x6 afterwards I had little energy left to go hard on accessories  so those were kept lighter  per the example schedule above     Conclusion    For me  the grueling challenge of high rep squats transcends the realm of mere physical exertion  High rep squatting involves not only physical strain but also a mental and emotional metamorphosis  The absence of a scientific rationale for their superiority in size or strength gains defies conventional wisdom  for the effort is not best suited for either  Rationally  the lifter prioritizing the theoretical  optimal  would not choose to do high rep squats  The allure and value of high rep squats are in the challenge itself  The Tom Platz experience unfolds as a personal odyssey  where each high rep set becomes a quest for self discovery and conquest   The intrinsic value of high rep squats is in the formidable nature of each set  with fear serving as the catalyst that validates the significance of the endeavor  That fear manifests as a driving force behind the pursuit of completing the reps  Before long  fear of the sets and the pain they bring  uncover a greater fear  wondering if I could do something but choosing not to because it would be hard  Then opting for comfort so long as I could tolerate the unique pain that ease bears   This experience produced an imaginary kinship with the legendary Tom Platz  despite our vast differences in ability  That he suffered before me was encouraging  What Tom could do  so could I  The nature of high rep squats reflects the universal human experience of foreboding before a daunting task  Though we may never know  I suppose that even the greats have experienced a moment of uncertainty and fear before such sets  underlining the innate transformative power of high rep squats  Speaking for myself  I know this to be true  Perhaps you too will experience the same   In the end  performing high rep squats is not just a conquest over physical pain but a triumph over the symptoms of fear itself  Workouts progress from initial intimidation to a realization that training is not about the destination  but  the transformation undergone in the process  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2023 04 physicality creativity and consciousness html   Each rep becomes a testament to the indomitable spirit that emerges when one is emptied of self and possessed by the pursuit  High rep squats are where fear yields to joy  and the cries of a new creation whisper the adage that  what one man can do  another can do  ,,

1arc3z7kqnjfhw,1arc3z7,kqnjfhw,NotBarnabyJ0nes,2024-02-16 06:37:05,,,21.0,,Here s a little tip I recently learned on how to store my meats for quick meal preps    I ll buy a 4lb pack of chicken thighs for example and instead of freezing them whole I ll thinly slice all of them and split between two large freezer bags  This gives me about 800 900 grams per bag  Using a cutting board  I ll flatten out the bag and get the chicken evenly distributed in a flat sheet  Then using the edge of the cutting board I ll press a   shape into the bag creating 4 smaller squares  Store the bag flat in the freezer     Now when ever I want to cook a meal I can just break off one of those squares which gives me about 200 225g of chicken  or roughly 60g of protein  and throw it straight in the pan to stir fry  Because the chicken is sliced into thin  bite sized pieces it will quickly heat up enough to separate and cook all the way through in only a few minutes  Throw in some frozen veggies  leftover rice and sauce and I have a full meal from nothing in less than 20 minutes    No more thawing hours before cooking or weighing out ingredients  The game changer is pressing that   shape into the chicken before freezing  Makes it so easy to break off exactly what I want and make sure I get the same amount for every meal  If you want more or less per serving just put more or less in the bag before sectioning and freezing  The thin slices speeds up the cooking time by quite a bit  It s been such a huge time saver in the kitchen and a big help in tracking my macros to know exactly what I m getting every time ,,

1bob6rgpost,1bob6rg,,gzcl,2024-03-26 15:50:23,Five Years Without a Rest Day,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/1bob6rg/,685.0,252.0,Hello   u gzcl here with another post about training without rest days  I recently crossed the five year mark of training without rest days  so I figured it warranted an update    Here  https   www reddit com r Fitness comments 12lgk9f four years without a rest day   is the update from last year  Many other details about my training  including videos of PR lifts  can be found in my post history  Instagram  YouTube  and blog  Each is linked throughout this post   Before we get into the post  I want to be clear that I am not saying that everyone should train without rest days  or that nobody needs them  or that I m better than anyone because I have not taken rest days  or that rest days are inherently useless or bad  or that not taking rest days always produce better results or training like this makes me a hard core tough guy type  So  please  do not read into this post such contrivances   Again  this post is not telling you that you absolutely do not need rest days  no matter what  This post is critical of rest days because it has been my experience that rest days are often taken for granted and are therefore abused  something which may inhibit training rather than aid it   Now  I would like to address some basic facts of who I am and what my situation is  These things will provide insight into why I chose to train without rest days  how I am able to do it  and why I am here encouraging you to consider whether rest days are necessary  based on your circumstances  abilities  and goals     About me         Age    38      Years Training    15       Bodyweight    205 to 210  daily average   Up from  158 on day 31  https   www instagram com p BwItaivA 2    of training without rest days       Height    5 5       Recent 1 Rep Maxes     525 squat  https   www instagram com p C0KGr8rAkAY  img index 1    340 bench  https   www instagram com p CuSzsrhgtCx     600 deadlift  https   www instagram com p C4qKfzxAq9K    no belt    250 strict press  https   www instagram com p Czw7oYDAwKT  img index 2     All these lifts were performed within the last year of training without rest days  The only lift that is not an all time PR 1RM is the bench  That is because the bench press messes with my shoulder  a longstanding injury that I am always training around as best as I can  my lifetime 1RM bench PR is 380 pounds  While 635 pounds is my best deadlift  it was with a belt  so the above linked deadlift is a PR of significant variation     Training Environment    Home gym for the first three ish years of training without rest days  then I opened my own gym  I train at very high elevation  over 10 000 feet  in a well outfitted commercial facility     Health    No chronic illnesses or diseases  I very rarely get sick  In these five years there was only one time where I had very bad congestion  I still trained  I opted to do a conditioning workout of KB swings and push ups  It was a great choice at the time because I felt much better the next day  The worst are migraines I get somewhat frequently  When this happens  I will just go lighter or change the plan of the day to doing arms  as those workouts are less stressful in general  If I am even feeling a bit under the weather  I train with reduced volume  intensity  or both  depending on the day and my assessment of where I am then standing recovery wise     Injuries    No serious recent injuries  mostly just training around or in consideration of preexisting injuries  sustained before training without rest days   This has limited the frequency of very heavy lifting  so I ve opted for more of a volume  and therefore  lighter weight approach in general  That said  I ve still hit 1RM personal records in these five years  I m just not lifting heavy each week because when I do I increase my chances of aggravating an old injury     Drug Use    No  I am not using steroids  testosterone  SARMS  or other such chemicals  peptides  hormones  etc  I do have low test and nearly a decade ago I tried TRT for a year  It did not help me  I do not claim to be a  lifetime natural   These five years of training without rest days was not benefitted by using such performance enhancements     Diet    Whatever my wife makes  or wherever we go out to eat  which is mostly Mexican food   I do not adhere to a strict diet  I eat a lot of breakfast burritos which have plenty of eggs and meat  Most of my diet is based around red meat  especially dinner  Lately  my household has been having a lot of hot pot  which is a copious amount of thin sliced meat  golden radishes  various noodles  and rice cakes  For the last five years I have been rotating different lengths of bulk and cut cycles  I have gained about 50 pounds in this period     Supplements    I try to take creatine and vitamin D consistently  Sometimes I miss days  Same goes for electrolytes  I may incorporate other supplements from time to time  such as fish oil  but have found much of that to have no clear benefit to performance  Not that I doubt those things  It just isn t a priority for me     Sleep    Average around 6 to 8 hours per night  Sometimes I get less  as I do suffer from sleepless nights occasionally  These may be just 2 to 4 hours of sleep  Still in such cases I will train  adjusting the goal of the session as needed  I do try to have a relatively strict bedtime     Why do I train daily     1  To see if I can  2   Because I enjoy the process  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2023 04 physicality creativity and consciousness html   despite some torturous individual sessions   3  It improves my mood and general outlook on life while at the same time  improving my quality of life by making everyday tasks easier  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022 10 1300 days process is goal html   shoveling snow in particular  by limiting the impact of old injuries  4  It keeps my efforts in the gym better regulated so that I do not go overboard in a single session   because tomorrow is a rest day   and risk injuring myself  as I ve done many times in the past when I was taking rest days     What does my training look like     The overwhelming majority of my workouts are based on my  General Gainz  https   www reddit com r gzcl comments aqkdgo happy gday gainerz   training framework  You can read more about programs and constructing workouts with GG on  my blog  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com    A very detailed description of GG and a progression constructed from that framework can be read in my blog   General Gainz Body Building  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022 01 general gainz body building html    Searching  General Gainz  on reddit will provide many reviews as well as examples of programs others have created with the framework or adapted existing programs to their needs and goals   In a nutshell  nearly all my workouts are based around using weights  When on vacation I ve had to do a few bodyweight workouts  Those would typically be done for reps against the clock  so a conditioning session  That said  I estimate that 99  of my workouts these last five years used weights of some kind  bars  dumbbells  kettlebells  cables   Most of my workouts in these five years have consisted of adding reps until I reach a determined volume threshold  then adding weight  this is called accumulation   By training in this way I have managed to set many rep max PR s  This is especially true for the squat because last year PR d rep maxes from  1RM  525LB  to 100RM  135LB   https   www reddit com r Fitness comments 1953k9l the tom platz experience pain pleasure and high     None of my workouts these last five years have consisted of only doing stretching or yoga  or going for a walk  hike  cardio only  or other such activities  I do not call shoveling snow a workout  nor chopping wood  As I live at over 10 000 feet elevation  my winters have plenty of those things which I just call  living   Some days I ll shovel snow for a few hours  then workout  That s just how it is  In general  my training resembles those common traits of strength and conditioning and or bodybuilding training   Because consistency is my primary goal  I am not stuck to a certain split or weekly training schedule  I have a loosely planned schedule and shift days as needed  based on how I assess my recovery  If I planned to squat but my legs are still very sore from a few days before  I will push that a day or two later  instead opting to do something like press  I have found that while I have successfully trained full body for many weeks on end  it does become tiresome  so when it does  I ll shift to a movement or body part split   There have been several periods of time in these five years where I have trained the same lift every day for many weeks  I have done this for squat  press  and most recently  the deadlift  Such periods were great for developing those lifts  In each time I was able to reach goals  setting new personal records  Just last week I hit a 600 pound beltless conventional deadlift  a lifetime 1RM PR  the most I ve ever deadlifted without a belt   That came on the heels of training the deadlift for ten weeks  every day  at submax weights and submax volume   Before testing that 1RM I did take two days off from deadlifting  training shoulders and triceps respectively   For context  in October 2023 I barely completed a  545 pound deadlift  https   www instagram com p CzJJIFmg7eF   while wearing a belt  and with the hype of doing that lift at my gym s deadlift party    Most of my workouts are an hour or less  If I do a conditioning workout  I try to keep those around 20 to 30 minutes  If you want to see more specific examples of workouts or lifts I ve done  you can see those on my  Instagram  https   www instagram com thefeverfever     YouTube  https   www youtube com  GZCL   blog  and previous posts here on reddit     The goals of this post are to prove that       1  Rest days are just another training variable that can be manipulated to benefit training     Rest days are like the weight on the bar  the number of reps  total volume  variety of exercises  rest times  lift frequency  and so many other variables when it comes to training  There is no optimal frequency of training that applies to everyone  Likewise  there is no optimal frequency of rest days that applies to everyone  Such is the nature of individual differences  When not taking rest days  other variables need to be adjusted to account for training the next day   Does this mean you probably cannot train every day to complete exhaustion  taking every lift to absolute failure  Yes  However  because training frequency is higher without rest days  that means skill development can be emphasized  This means greater efficiency and lower risk of injury  thereby improving work capacity and recovery potential  Over time these improve how well you can recover from heavier and or higher volume workouts  So  as work capacity and skill increases  your ability to perform and recover from tougher workouts more frequently will likewise improve     2  Excluding rest days does not necessarily inhibit progress to either size or strength     Before these five years I trained with rest days  I had competed in powerlifting for several years  During that period I won best lifter at a state championship as well as competing several times at the USPA American Cup and the IPL World Championships  often placing first in my weight class  I was decently strong for a lightweight powerlifter who moved up from the 148 class to the 181 class over four years   I am now bigger than I ve ever been  both in terms of overall bodyweight and the measurements across my shoulders  chest  legs  and arms  I recently achieved  18  arms  https   www instagram com p C2TngiMAZ w  img index 1  for the first time in my life  a goal I had set a few years ago  I also set all time personal records in many lifts  despite not training how powerlifters usually do   Not only that  but I have trained several clients who also no longer take rest days  Each of them improving their own size and or strength  So  not only have I grown bigger and stronger without rest days compared to those times when I was taking rest days  I have also witnessed others do the same  I credit this largely to increased training frequency and finally prioritizing more impactful recovery habits  sleep  nutrition  hydration  and de stressing   When it comes to recovering from training  those practices matter a whole lot more than days of inactivity  AKA  Rest Days       3  Excluding rest days is a great catalyst for improving training consistency     When taking rest days it was easy for me to justify going too hard because  tomorrow is a rest day   This would frequently result in going too hard  thereby necessitating unaccounted for deloads and rest days  at the time I thought rest days were a make or break recovery factor   Such training is akin to two steps forward one step back  and sometimes  many steps back  That kind of regression can be demotivating  which may result in a period of not training at all  While I didn t have many of those periods  and was consistent before training without rest days  now my training is far more consistent  Not only in terms of frequency  but also in terms of intensity  volume  and effort   Without rest days I have learned how to better dial in my training  resulting in more effective workouts  Such compounding results add up  Training without rest days is now one step forward  followed by another  and countless others  Because my training is better regulated without rest days  I have not sustained a major injury that resulted in significant setbacks  Lastly  I don t have to drag myself into the gym anymore  It is now just something I do  and I am nearly every day looking forward to my workout  some workouts I know will be grueling  and I do not look forward to those as much   This is because nearly every workout produces results  albeit small  they are frequent and just as rewarding     4  Excluding rest days can improve training knowledge  knowing how to train      Because I am not taking rest days I must account for the other variables when it comes to my training and align those in such a way that both produces results while at the same time allowing for training again tomorrow  This means that I am more aware of my effort  volume  and intensity  Without rest days  learning how to train happens faster  resulting in better progress sooner  I am now better at choosing exercises that benefit me and the way in which I execute those movements  For example  I am no longer benching as often because I feel I should  or simply that it is  in my program  so I must do it   Rather  I limit that as needed while being more aggressive with other upper body pressing movements   Similarly  I am better at constructing and executing fruitful workouts  compared to times past  when I would frequently go off plan and do more than needed  at the time believing that pushing myself to complete exhaustion and nearly always taking sets to failure was necessary to progress  That is not the case for me  or anyone  While I do believe that minimal is not optimal  the idea that more is always better is also not true  When it comes to training  as much as you can recover from is best  The only way to know that limit is to train enough to learn what that limit is and the various ways in which that limit can be reached  all while understanding that your limit will increase over time  and when it does  so too must your training     5  Rest days are not the make or break factor when it comes to recovering from workouts     As I ve said many times these last five years  the recovery habits that matter most are sleep  nutrition  hydration  and de stressing  Rest days  meaning days of inactivity  are at best the worst form of recovery  Recovery depends on your work capacity  If you can only do little  you can recover from little  Gradually improving your work capacity through training increases your ability to recover  That process requires the all important factors of sleep  nutrition  hydration  and limiting non training related stress  not sedentary days   Days of inactivity are counterproductive most of the time  Such days would be better spent doing low impact training like pushing a sled  or cardio  thereby improving your work capacity and therefore your ability to recover from future workouts  If rest days were necessary  then I would not have grown as big and as strong as I have in these last five years  I ve seen many people online say that not taking rest days produces negative results  guaranteed injury  burnout  and other such undesirable outcomes  The opposite is true  that is  if you learn how to train without rest days  something which necessitates prioritizing genuine recovery habits     Common Objections    In previous posts here on reddit  or as I ve experienced on social media  people have said a few things about my not taking rest days  Here I will address these common objections and criticisms to training daily     1   But you cannot train hard  or  You re not training hard enough  by not taking rest days       Response    In these last five years I have grown bigger and stronger than I ve ever been  My training is effective  With it I have achieved many goals  Whether you call it  hard  means nothing in the face of my results  Hard training  while important  is not the harbinger of results  Consistency  effort  and patience are  Daily training bolsters those three all important factors   The definition of  training hard  is individually dependent  Some will say that all sets must be taken to failure  or very close  to train hard  Others will say that massive amounts of volume are needed to train hard  Still more will say other things about what it means to train hard  drop sets  limited rest  supersets  no machines   functional training  only  etc  In every case the assumption is that training hard  every workout  is necessary to progress in the gym  The reality is that our definition of hard is only as hard as we ve ever pushed ourselves  Your hard may be my easy  or vice versa   That  training hard  is necessary to progress is a false premise often made by those whose egos are built on how hard they proclaim their training to be  The fact is  my training is as hard as it needs to be  based on the session s goal and how I determine my recovery to be  I have done many of the hardest workouts of my life in these last five years  But many are not nearly so difficult  Not every session needs to be as tough as the one before it  This truth is obvious when comparing leg workouts to arm workouts  Leg days are a meme for hardship whereas arm days are often believed to be easy   because it is true  Even the hardest arms workout pales in comparison to the hardest legs workout  I will always do an arm workout when I am not feeling well because they are the easiest workouts to do with a high degree of focus  quality effort  reps  and volume   Training consistency and recovery from that training matters far more than proximity to failure  or the volume of a single session  or other such minutia of which so many overemphasize so that they can deem their training  hard   and therefore  themselves   For me personally  I find lifting near max weights to be a whole lot harder than doing near max volume  It is tougher for me to recover from  Therefore  I do a lot more volume based training  Does that mean my training is always easy because I prefer it  I guess in some way  yes  But I do not train so that I can feel hard or say that I do hard things  I train  firstly because I enjoy the process  and secondly  so that I can achieve goals   Is that process sometimes difficult  Yes  Does progress depend on training always being difficult  No  Sometimes one more rep or one more pound comes easily  and those are just two forms of many kinds of progress to be made in the gym     2   Training every day doesn t make you more hard core  and  Hard core lifters cannot train daily   therefore  I am not hard core  as such accusers themselves identify        Response    I agree with this  I am not hard core for training daily  Furthermore  manufactured hardship  as weight training necessarily is  is something I do not see has being inherently or distinctly  hard   There is nothing  hard core  about the gym  It is quite a comfortable hobby  even when it is difficult  Even when there is pain  or  paradoxically  discomfort  the act of weight training is safe  nearly always indoors in climate controlled gyms  with purpose built equipment  done for self improvement via sustained incremental progress  It costs money and time  It is firstly  a selfish act  It is  therefore  not a practice through which one experiences genuine hardship and thereby becomes hard themselves  Lifting weights is a luxury  a pleasure  and therefore  not hard core  I don t pretend it is and hope more begin to see it my way     3  Training every day is not optimal       Response    This argument is often paired alongside the idea that training hard is required to progress  Thus  rationally  though incorrect   if training hard then rest days are necessary because if you are not taking rest days then you cannot be training hard  Superficially  this makes sense  However  after a moment of deeper consideration  even the meatiest head will see that it is possible to train hard one way and the next day train something else just as hard  Such is possible when employing any kind of split  whether that be by movement  or body part  or other variables such as volume  intensity  or density   As touched on in the previous section  sometimes progress comes easily  It has been my experience that with a sensible structure and methodical progression  bolstered by keen autoregulation practices  that adding another rep or putting on five more pounds is less daunting compared to those times when I was always grinding myself into dust trying to eek out every pound  every rep  at every opportunity   at the cost of pain  which I conflated with progress  a common outlook regarding training  Such a mindset about training is based on the fear of missing out  FOMO   which from my experience  produces short lived results  injuries  and dwindling enthusiasm in the gym   There is no standard of  optimal  that applies to everyone  The most recoverable work is optimal  That depends on the individual  That said  there is truth in the importance of frequency  volume  intensity  meaning load respective of 1RM   and effort  None of those things can be eschewed completely  Each is a variable that must be deliberately adjusted based on the individual s goals and abilities  The first among those variables is frequency  something which rest days inherently limits  Higher training frequency means more opportunities to reach the limit of recoverable work  which is always the most optimal way to train  Frequency is king among variables   Mentzer cultists in shambles       4    But you would be bigger and stronger if you were taking rest days        Response    Such hackneyed remarks are made by those trying to ignite FOMO within me without considering my training history  For a decade I took rest days and  trained hard   as I understood it then   I was strong then  But now  I am both bigger and stronger   without taking rest days   This bromide idea is held by those say   Rest days produce results  not the training  in one breath and in the next say   I train harder than you  so I need rest days   So  which is it  If the first  then training hard does not matter  only the rest days  If the second  then the training matters more than the rest days  The third position is that both matter equally  then necessitating equal rest days to training days  something not seen amongst the biggest and strongest lifters who often promote training up to 6x a week and sometimes multiple times per day   This statement placates the accuser who themselves has FOMO about their training and their recovery  believing that without rest days they would be missing out on gains  I would bet the opposite because I ve experienced it myself  Rest days limited my progress because I trained less and my training was less recoverable because I over emphasized the importance of inactivity  placing it above better means of recovery   Rest days improving recovery is not a guarantee for everyone  because as I said above  rest days are merely another variable  They are not a fixed need and are the lowest tier of importance when it comes to recovering from workouts  Do some people need rest days  yes  Might they see better results without them  Perhaps  That is only knowable if one attempts to train without rest days  adjusting other variables as needed  including prioritizing the more important aspects of recovery  sleep  nutrition  hydration  and de stressing      5   The science shows that rest days are needed to progress        Response    This is a false claim made by those appealing to an authority which they have no meaningful connection to or understanding of  There is not a single study that unequivocally proves that regardless of how one trains that rest days are required to get bigger and stronger  Such claims are often paired with remarks about  CNS burnout  or  systemic fatigue  which is also false  Lifting weights is remarkably easier to recover from than other activities  in particular running  which people do daily for years on end without objection  How  By adjusting the many variables we have at our disposal to increase our training frequency   Though some authorities on training may claim rest days are needed  they lack practical experience training without them while at the same time carrying a bias due to their investment in particular methods of training and the brand in which their status rests upon  Might rest days be needed because of the way they train and their recovery habits  Sure  That  however  does not prove that progress cannot be made unless rest days are taken  One such figure is Mike Israetel  PhD   who made a video on this topic  which  I responded to here  https   www youtube com watch v aAZ85sXNJKQ   Though highly credentialed and regarded in the training community  his take is remarkably bad  irrational  and contradicts his own material     Conclusion    Rest days  commonly practiced as day of low activity or inactivity  encourage doing too much in the gym in a single workout than one can recover from while at the same time limiting training frequency and therefore slow the improvement of work capacity and skill development  That was the case when I was taking rest days during the first decade of my training and I am sure it is for many of you  Therefore  I argue that rest days can inhibit progress rather than help it  as they did my own  As a result of my experience  I encourage you to see if increasing your training frequency  with a likewise increase in your recovery habits  sleep  nutrition  hydration  and de stressing  will increase your results   Consider whether rest days are something that inhibits you or benefits you  Are rest days when you backslide  eat poorly  sleep little  and stress over other parts of your life  Are they days you take because you find yourself going too hard in the gym and frequently grinding yourself into the dirt and potentially causing injury  Or might rest days be days you need because you simply do not like training  Think about your rest days and why you take them  and how you can make them better   perhaps including not taking them and training instead  Decreasing days of inactivity might not mean lifting weights more often  but perhaps doing more cardio  or some other form of physical exercise that you enjoy  Training without rest days for you does not have to look how it does for me  Find the appropriate level of activity for you  and should you find that to be lacking  strive to gradually do more ,,

1cg1ufjpost,1cg1ufj,,DadliftsnRuns,2024-04-29 15:23:26,"Ultrarunning and Strength Training - Racing 100 miles while Benching 405+ & Deadlifting 600+ - My take on ""Hybrid Training"", and how to get started if you want to lift heavy AND run extreme distances.",https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/1cg1ufj/,472.0,65.0,It used to be  that there were strength athletes  and then there were endurance athletes  With very little overlap in disciplines  Obviously  there were people in sports doing both  but they generally specialized in one  and only dabbled in the other sporadically    These days social media is absolutely inundated with   Hybrid athletes    men and women who see themselves  not just as a runner  or cyclist  or powerlifter  or bodybuilder  but as a combination of 2   wildly incongruent  disciplines   These   Hybrid Athletes   often fill their social media with messages about how you can become strong  and fast  and that you do not have to choose between one or the other  as long as you   Just buy their program and products      Well today  I would like to share some of my thoughts on    hybrid training     But before we get into the thick of it  a quick TLDR for those of you not interested in reading the whole post is below      TLDR         Hybrid Training       isn t going to make you an elite athlete  You likely won t be setting any records in either of your chosen sports if you go this route  You might get quite good at one  and proficient at the other  or if you are very gifted  maybe you will get really good at both  but you will never be ELITE        setting national  records in both sports simultaneously        at two sports that require incredibly different training methodologies and favor opposing body types  The online influencers and       coaches       do not have a magic formula to get you fast and jacked  The truth is that       hybrid training        WILL      give you worse results than focusing on one sport  however  the variety can be very rewarding  How you go about this is all very simple  it s just also incredibly time consuming      note  I really hate the term    hybrid athlete    and do not consider myself to be an  athlete  at all  I am just a working father and husband that enjoys running and lifting  So from this point on in the post  I will be avoiding it           Who am I   i e   credentials      Some of you may recognize me from previous posts  such as       OVERTRAINED  Deadlift     Where  I deadlifted 605  every day for 50 days  ending in a 765lb 1rm  https   www reddit com r Fitness s qpgVJVl6Jb   Or      OVERTRAINED  Bench     Where  I Benched 345  every day for 50 days  ending in a 465lb 1rm  https   www reddit com r Fitness s vTeEmUufnR   I have also created and shared a few popular programs over the years  which have helped many of you on your strength goals   More recently  I ran 100 miles through the rain and mud  at the Rocky Raccoon 100  in Huntsville Texas  A race that saw over half the field drop out due to the horrible trail conditions  Despite the rain  flooded trails  mud  and slop  which resulted in macerated feet  blisters  and losing toenails  I pushed through and made it to the end   Then  just 3 days later  I  loaded up 4 plates on the bar  and hit a 405 lb bench press  https   www reddit com r GYM s dFt3M7E7dh   A combination of achievements that has rarely    if ever     before been achieved   I spent the subsequent 10 weeks following the race hitting consistent 70 100  mile weeks  while lifting 2 3x per week  leading up to this friday  where I  Deadlifted 617 pounds  and then immediately began a 63 mile run through the night  https   www reddit com r weightroom s ZW5Xl5Snpz  another fun mix of heavy lifting and long distance  this time  done as a solo event with my 3 year old Australian Shepherd      A bit more background   some Notable PR s     I started ice skating at just 3 years old  played hockey  baseball  football  worked on a farm  hunted  and was generally extremely active throughout my entire childhood  At the age of 12 I began lifting in the gym with my dad  and he taught me all the basics of barbell training  I also stayed involved in sports  and competed as a varsity athlete until going off to college  I am a registered professional engineer  and own operate a business  while raising a young family of 3 children with my wife  who I have been with for nearly 18 years  After 20  total years of training  I reached my peak lifting numbers in 2021  when I competed in a powerlifting meet  and set the deadlift record for my state  with a 716lb lift  After the competition I made a drastic shift over to running as my main priority  and signed up for my first ultramarathon  A 50 kilometer trail race in central Minnesota     I set all my Personal Records in lifting and running between September 2021 and the present day  a period of 2 5 years  Those PR s were     606 squat    465 bench    765 sumo deadlift   700 conventional   716 State Record Deadlift     5 10 Mile    18 34 5k    3 18 Marathon    Completed at least a marathon and or an ultramarathon every month for going on 2  years  with distances up to 100 miles   All of these can be found in my extensive post history here on reddit        So  after that first 50k trail ultramarathon  I was hooked  I signed up for a 100k  and started running 50 100  mile weeks   In 2023 I logged 3465 miles  with long runs extending beyond the marathon distance of 26 2 miles  up to 50  miles  at least once per month  Some were sanctioned races  some were solo adventures  but they all pushed me closer to my goal  Running 100 miles at the Rocky Raccoon 100  in February 2024  which I finished just 12 weeks ago   Rocky Raccoon was an incredibly difficult race  primarily due to the rain and mud  but it just fueled my desire for more  and I am already signed up for my next 100 miler  coming up in August of this year  with some solo ultra adventures in between  and my first 200 miler in 2025   I am also back to lifting heavy  having squatted 445  benched 405  and deadlifted 635 in the weeks following the race   So that s enough about me  lets get to the main point of this post           A little motivation    Harder  Better  Faster  Stronger   Daft Punk   https   youtu be gAjR4  CbPpQ si TD5S9F3UuGVyhdww      Over the last few years I have written quite a bit on reddit about how I go about my training  to be able to consistently finish ultramarathons  while maintaining enough strength to deadlift 600  or bench 400    If you spend enough time in my post history  I am certain that you will find some very contradictory opinions on training philosophies  diet  recovery etc  This has all been a long learning process for me  as I have experimented and manipulated all the variables in my life to maximize performance in two sports that don t typically mix very well  all while leading a busy home and work life   So lets discuss the logistics of training     How hard is it to train for an ultramarathon while maintaining enough strength to bench press over 405 pounds  or deadlift 600       How hard should individual training sessions be to facilitate productive adaptations  without impacting recovery      How hard is it to stick to a diet that can support all of this training      How hard is it to coordinate all the training with a busy work and family life   When I talk about how  hard  something is  I want to clarify that this isn t a David Goggins style speech on  Staying Hard   That isn t my style at all  there are days you will need to dial things back  and there are far more important things in my life than training  Instead  its just a straightforward discussion of the facts around training to run  and lift  at a decent level  and the difficulties one must deal with if they want to succeed  As always  family and work come first  but when those aspects are properly taken care of  its time to train     x200B        These days  training to reach the top in any activity requires an absolute focus and specialization  You don t become an elite 5k runner by improving your deadlift  You don t become a Chess grandmaster by spending time out on the driving range working on your tee shot  and you don t become an elite skier by playing video games  You need to put all of your free time and energy into your chosen sport activity  This isn t any different for strength endurance   hybrid   athletes looking to get faster and stronger    The problem is  that is the essence of training for strength and endurance simultaneously  You are taking time away from one activity to train another  that has very little  if any  applicable carryover      If you are just starting out  you can do both  and you can improve at both  and you can do so for a very long time  Most of the people in this subreddit will fall into this category  and should leave this post knowing that they can run and lift and make gains  and that they don t need to worry about   the interference effect   https   www strongerbyscience com research spotlight interference effect       Lift weights  do your cardio  and get better      x200B   But for those of you striving for more  those of you who want to be the best of the best at what you do  eventually  one activity   MUST   give way for the other    I have fought this realization for the last 2 3 years  trying to maintain as much strength as possible while getting faster and building my endurance  but I have reached  at least my personal  genetic and time limitations  I can no longer keep pushing and building at both  and therefore I have decided to back off the heavy strength training  to make way for more running improvements  I am cutting weight  and knowingly getting weaker on the main lifts  but the tradeoff is clear  I m getting faster even at nearly 37 years old  and my ability to endure long distances has improved drastically   So why does this happen  Why do we hit a point where we can no longer improve  Does running interfere with muscle gain that much    Honestly  while that is part of the equation  I do not believe that it is the main issue  In my opinion  the biggest hurdle when it comes to training for ultras and high level strength training       IS TIME     Let s break down my week as an example  I am running a MINIMUM of 70 miles per week right now  I have been doing so for 10 consecutive weeks  since the Rocky Raccoon 100  and plan to continue doing so all year  I have hit multiple weeks of 80   90   and even 100  miles since then  This amount of running takes a lot of time   If you average 8 00 mi  a 75 mile week takes 10 hours  At 10 00 mile  you are looking at over 12 hours  Throw in some trail runs and hiking in the mountains  and suddenly you could be looking at 15 16  hours just for the running alone    Now you want to add in 40 50  hours per week of work  plus commute time  50 60  hours per week of sleep  time for meals  time for chores and a multitude of additional life obligations  and still make time for your family  going to soccer practices and piano recitals  math club  and family game night  and the remaining time for going to the gym starts to really get slim   So do you go get that additional 8 mile run in on a Saturday afternoon  Or do you try to deadlift on fatigued legs  or do you watch Bluey with your daughter  you must decide on your own  but no matter which choice you make  it comes at the expense of all the other things   Because of this  my training schedule includes a LOT of doubles    I wake up early  while my wife and kids are still sleeping  and I run 5 10 miles   Then  later in the day  I either go to the gym during my lunch break  or I run again   Monday through Thursday  in just 4 days  I am generally logging 8 training sessions  but they are all on MY time  when they wont interfere with my family or work obligations   These doubles  come at the cost of sleep  and  training instead of resting recovering at lunch  I wake up at 4 00am  and I m busy until my head hits the pillow  after my kids are tucked in  For many people  this is not a sustainable choice to make  For me  I love it  It gives me structure and purpose outside of everyday life   On that topic of fatigue  when you are pairing your lifting and running together  a major area of concern is going to be   how to structure your training    so that it can be productive  I will go into this later in more detail  but its important to note  that for this type of training to work  you NEED to know how to take an easy day  while still getting work done  Note  I didn t say a REST day  I said an EASY day  There is a big difference  and with time limitations already being an issue  you need to train as often as you have time     Another key aspect to fatigue management  is diet    Everyone has their own opinions on diets  and some people are incredibly militant about them  so I am not going to spend too much time on it  but I will say this   Carbohydrates   WILL   improve your performance  Go ahead and be low carb keto if that s what you want  but just know that you are adding an artificial handicap to your training     If you aren t recovering between sessions  eat and sleep more     If you are sore  eat and sleep more   If you are tired before a workout  you need to eat and sleep more  Food fuels your training  and along with sleep  facilitates your recovery  If you are low on energy  you will not be productive in the gym or in your running   I use an app called  Macrofactor  to track my weight and caloric intake  and with my weekly mileage and lifting factored into things  I require a bit over 4 800 calories per day  just to maintain my bodyweight     x200B            So what does my training look like  What should your training look like      Coming off of the Rocky Raccoon 100 mile race  and training leading up to my next 100  I am aiming to run a MINIMUM of 70 miles per week  with most weeks closer to 80  and peak weeks exceeding 100 miles  while lifting at least 2 times per week    On a day by day basis  that looks something like this   https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1qf  Fx3T1tDraqlgImbtd9q1vZd3eSgeA edit usp drive  link ouid 105219797917450253924 rtpof true sd true   Monday Thursday all include doubles  with easy morning runs  and then lifting  or running again in the afternoon   Fridays are recovery days  where I usually cycle  but also occasionally add more miles in with my wife or kids if they want to go for a run   Saturdays are long run days  Sundays are more open  to fill in missing mileage  lifting  or just resting if I have completed my goal weekly distance and lifting   If you look closely at the Weekly Schedule  you will see that I am trying to   seperate hard efforts     by as many hours as possible    with the exception of Thursday  which has 2x hard efforts   The reason for this separation needs explanation    When getting advice from a running coach  they will tell you to do your hard running workouts first  and any heavy lifting later that day  but to keep your hard days hard  and your easy days easy   When getting advice from a strength coach  they will tell you to do your hard lifting first  and any HIIT interval work after  and once again  to keep your hard days hard  and your easy days easy   The reason they suggest this  is because they care first and foremost about getting the maximum stimulus and adaptation from the first workout  when you are fresh and rested  The second workout is guaranteed to suffer  But you keep it on the same day  so that you allow enough rest time before the next hard effort of a primary workout    So if you are a runner  you don t want to run hard Monday  squat hard Tuesday  and run hard Wednesday  That leaves very little time for recovery  And the same goes for someone only interested in strength training     However    If you care about improving both equally  this is a recipe for failure  Over the years  the solution I have come up with  is to reduce the VOLUME of hard efforts  but to do them on their own days  This way each individual session doesn t destroy you  it doesn t take as long to recover from  but you can do both types of training more often         So what does  reducing the volume of hard efforts  look like  well  lets start with running for our example  Lets say you are running a marathon training program  we are going to look at the  Hal Higdon advanced Marathon 1  https   www halhigdon com training programs marathon training advanced 1 marathon  for our example    If you scroll down the page here  you will see the way he has set up your weekly running  On Thursdays he has speedwork  In week 3 he has 4x800m intervals scheduled  On week 6 this goes to 5x800  and by week 15 it has progressed all the way up to 8x800m intervals  That s 4 miles of hard efforts  That is going to have a big hit on recovery  If all you are doing is running and training for a marathon  that s going to be just fine  But you aren t just interested in running here  You are trying to run  and build strength in the gym  You want to run a marathon and squat 500 pounds  You want to complete an ultramarathon and still be able to rep 315 on the bench the next week  so that volume needs to be reduced  You don t need to run those intervals slower  you don t need to change the schedule  just do a fewer total number  Instead of 4x800 in week 3  and 8x800 in week 15  start with half the volume  and see how you adapt and recover  2x800 thrown into a nice mid distance run should be easy enough to recover from  and within a few weeks maybe you can build that up to 4 6x800m   The same reduction in volume of hard efforts works for your lifting as well  Instead of hitting 5 sets of 3 at 85 90   on your heavy day  maybe you are only hitting 1 2 sets  but you keep the intensity high  Work up to a top set or two  then move on  so that you can get the adaptations brought on by heavy lifting  without all the added fatigue of crushing yourself with set after set after set   The tradeoff here is obviously that you will progress at both modalities slower  But one step forward on strength and endurance  is better than two steps forward on one  and one step back on the other        The other thing you will notice  is the sheer volume of easy running I am doing  My primary sport now is ultrarunning  and with that  I do not need to do a ton of fast intervals  in fact the interval work I do have included is probably too short for my goals   it s a remnant from when I was working on my mile time   But all those long easy runs build your base  and if you are beginner  they will also help you get faster   This might be one of my more controversial opinions  but I think doing intervals speedwork on a low mileage program   20mpw  is a waste of time for most people that have a strength background  and they would be better served by adding mileage          So what are we getting at here  what is the point of this post     1  You can get pretty good at both running and lifting  but you can t be truly elite at both simultaneously  2  Cardio will help your lifting  and lifting will help your running  up to a point  There ARE diminishing returns  and eventually even a negative response when you get more advanced in each discipline   3  Try to separate your lifts and runs by as many hours as possible when you do them both on the same day  4  Keep most of your mileage easy  5  Do your hard runs and hard lifts on separate days if possible  6  Do the harder workout first  follow up with the easier  hard run  easy lift  or hard lift  easy run   7  Increase mileage before worrying about pace   8  carbs are magical  9  two 10ks will be easier to recover from than a single 20k  but they don t have quite the same training effect  so split up runs when needed  but try to get at least a few runs per week that are longer   10  finally  this is really unpopular to say these days  as everyone wants to tell you that you can be a runner and be fat overweight at the same time  but the truth is  losing weight   WILL   help your running if you are overweight  and gaining weight   WILL   help your lifting if you are underweight  being lean at whatever weight you choose will help you perform best at both  so drop that bodyfat        I could continue this for pages  but it has gone on long enough  So ask questions and I will try to answer them  or call me dumb for writing this ridiculously long post as an old man with  mid results   I m here for it ,,

 I have surpassed 2 000 consecutive training days  Along the way I have grown bigger  stronger  and generally more fit  This is because training without rest days requires sustainability above all else  To accomplish that  my priorities as a lifter have shifted to consistency  patience  and effort  These are what I have previously referred to as   the triumvirate of progress  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2022     Those three priorities govern sustainable progress  meaning gains     What this post is not       me saying that rest days are wholly or even generally unwarranted     me saying that rest days are bad  suboptimal  unscientific  etc     me making a moral or ethical argument about rest days themselves     me trying to make you feel bad for taking rest days       This post is       an anecdote about training without rest days and how daily training has benefitted me     Stats    Age  38 7  Gender  Man let   Weight  210  Height  LOL  Lifts  Squat

https   www instagram com p Czw7oYDAwKT  img index 2    Natty Status  I was on TRT nearly a decade ago  Tried it for a year  Didn t benefit from it like I thought I would based on what I was told at the time  Nothing during this period  I have not and do not claim to be a  lifetime natural      Why I decided to start training daily  and heaps of other detailed information     That and more can be

workouts without a rest day      Training without rest days has benefited me because           By prioritizing sustainability over all else  I make better training decisions  This results in fewer injuries and minor setbacks  meaning more gains with less risk          Lifting is something I enjoy  so I do it often and feel better because of it   https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2023 04 physicality creativity and consciousness html         Frequency is a significant factor in making progress  whether that is gaining size or strength  I am now bigger than I ve ever been and stronger in nearly every lift         My general fitness has improved due to the increased training frequency allowing for more training diversity  Meaning more opportunities to include conditioning workouts whereas previously nearly all my workouts were strength oriented because  I didn t have time to do conditioning  consistently  an excuse    You might benefit similarly if you decide to train without rest days  You might not  All I can say definitively is that I am happy with my results and because training is itself a luxury and a pleasurable experience  I will continue to do it daily   Counterintuitively  busier people seem to do better with daily training  This is because a three   four   or five day training week  as is typical  packs in exercises and a progression that can take an hour or more to complete  Busy people often do not have that kind of time  I have found that my busy clients can manage 30 to 45 minutes consistently and sometimes even less than that  So  to accomplish their goals they have started training daily  with each workout being shorter  biasing the program towards consistency  which ushers results when coupled with patience  effort  and of course sensible exercise selection  volume  and intensity progression   While most of my training has been based on my  General Gainz training framework  https   www reddit com r gzcl comments aqkdgo happy gday gainerz    there are occasions when my progress is not derived from General Gainz  or even my own  original training structure  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2014 07 the gzcl method simplified 13 html   modeled after a pyramid   These resources will provide to you a reasonable structure with which you can build your own training programs  Even brief ones  so that you can also begin training daily  if it is right for you  some may have contraindications    There are two things that have recently benefitted my training  The first was when I ran a program called Maelstrom which resulted in a lifetime personal record  600 pound beltless deadlift  https   youtu be q0 bACQ8MvI si YjLVb1mWvqcaiBps   Here is  a review another user wrote  https   www reddit com r weightroom comments 1cy1oq2 upcoming program review gzcl maelstrom for   of their experience running that program  This was a very unusual approach to training the deadlift because it is high frequency  high volume  and low intensity   The second occasion was when I had only a brief period to get a training session in  This happens somewhat regularly now because I own my own business  To train effectively in a short period of time I would do workouts that I began to call Monotony  These helped me maintain the daily training streak because even if I had only 15 minutes in my schedule  I could still hammer a lift and benefit from the workout  Perhaps you would likewise benefit   You can read  Maelstrom   Monotony  https   swoleateveryheight blogspot com 2024 10 2000 days maelstrom monotony html  and watch me perform those workouts on my blog and Instagram  On my blog you will have access to an updated program compendium  so that way you can perhaps run one of my old programs like GZCLP  Jacked   Tan 2 0  or try drowning in deadlifts by running Maelstrom   I wish you the best with your training  If you have any questions  drop them in the comments and I ll do my best to answer them ,,

1f8ojv8llgl87j,1f8ojv8,llgl87j,TheSeatedSlimShady,2024-09-04 13:02:53,,,67.0,,I started biking during the pandemic when all the gyms were closed  I found I it significantly better for cardio than anything inside a gym  I enjoy it and it really helped transition me from trying to lift as much as possible to getting into the best shape   One thing I don t enjoy and actually really hate is random ass dudes drafting off me  About once every week or so I will look behind me because I need to go into the road to pass someone and there is a spandex clad skeleton about a foot behind my back tire  I then try to shake them but it doesn t work  I speed up  they speed up  I slow down  they slow down  It is insanely frustrating for a few reasons   1  I do 20 miles a day but I am not super serious  I ride a gravel bike and I wear gym shorts with either a t shirt or tank top  I am on the faster side for where I bike  18 19 mph  but from appearances I don t know why people do this  2  Most of the time I ride around a 5 mile loop in a park  But it s a park    so there are pedestrians  there are children  dogs  cars  and  the biggest hazard of all  oblivious old people  There s a lot of times where you have to stop or dodge people  Not ideal for tailgating someone  Again  I am not in the Olympics or Tour de France  3  Most importantly  I DON T FUCKING KNOW THESE PEOPLE  I don t have a problem with people drafting off each other  I don t have a problem with people taking cycling seriously  I see people all in the same colors drafting off each other  But to draft off a random person is so annoying  Why is it my fucking problem that you want to follow someone so closely  Is the 1  faster you will go so fucking important  Why should I have to come to a complete stop so you leave me the fuck alone   Now here is why I am pissed  A couple weeks ago I had a spandex clad skeleton drafting off me  It was a Saturday where I take a different route to break the monotony  I needed to do a U turn  I extend my left arm out to signal I m turning because I knew a dude was behind me  I wait 1 or 2 seconds and start turning  Well  this guy thought   oh  I should take this opportunity to pass him on the left   I turn and the dude hits me  He falls off his bike and starts flipping out  HOW IS THIS MY FAULT  I signal I m turning then I turn  The dude was insistent that I should have stopped because I knew he was behind me  I did know he was behind me and that is why I signaled  I have been on the opposite end of that situation probably 50 times  I either slow down or pass them on the right  I m just pissed because what if I fell off my bike and why the fuck would this be at all my fault ,,

1dkzhpml9om7q8,1dkzhpm,l9om7q8,BoulderBlackRabbit,2024-06-21 22:30:00,,,6.0,,Why would you stay out of the gym and fast for a week   If you d like to lose fat  track your calories  Calculate how much you need to eat to maintain  then eat a few hundred calories less than that  If you don t lose weight  drop the calories by 100 for a couple of weeks  Lather  rinse  repeat    Did I mention you should track your calories   Don t stop going to the gym  You need to keep on strength training so you DON T lose muscle as you cut  It s not going to be a quick process you should probably aim to only lose about one percent of your body weight per week to minimize muscle loss  But trying to do it fast and chewing up any muscle will mean you burn fewer calories at rest  so that ll be detrimental to your goals    Slow and steady  Learn to be hungry and be okay with it  Learn to eat high volume foods to stay full  air popped popcorn  most veggies  some fruits   It s not a race to see who can get the thinnest the fastest    ,,Physique Phriday
