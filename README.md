TO walk through this reposit we can start by the IDEA:
we created a service that recommends users posts depending on their interests  and posts in sports field that can handle a big flux in data through our pipeline built on Apache . THE model we built ia a powerful recommendation system that loops and feedhimself ensuring model  continuous improveement and in real time   (for example the user says that he likes push ups, his feed would be filled with posts related to push ups and exercises of that genre) .
THE ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE IS SHOWN in the graph of the main folder followed by the pipeline architecture
